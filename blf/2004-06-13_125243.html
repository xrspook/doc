                            <h1>Episode 2</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2004-06-13 12:52:43+08:00</p><p>分类: EcoModa</p><p>标签: summary_of_EcoModa_from_rincondebetty_</p><hr><p>Episode 2</p><p>Armando:  Betty, my love, look - I think we need to talk about this, we need to clarify this or something - you know?</p><p>Betty:  Everything&#39;s already very clear for me.  And don&#39;t even bother trying to tell me this doesn&#39;t have to do with a woman.</p><p>Armando:  Well, yes, it does have to do with a woman.  And that&#39;s precisely what we need to talk about.</p><p>Betty:  I - I don&#39;t see why I should discuss her, or any other woman, with you.  I don&#39;t see why I should put myself through that... </p><p><Betty stands up and goes toward her old office, but Armando detains her...></p><p>Armando:  No, no, no it&#39;s not that - it&#39;s not that...  Look, she is the Director of New Projects for Fashion Group, ok?  She&#39;s interested in EcoModa, and arrives in Bogotá tonight, that&#39;s all.</p><p>Betty:  Then it has to do with business?</p><p>Armando:  Of course it has to do with business...</p><p>Betty:  But those phone calls were very mysterious...  Look, Armando, I&#39;m not going to interrogate you.  I&#39;m not going to demand details, much less create an uproar over this, because that&#39;s not the way I am.  And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you expect from me, either...</p><p>Armando:  And I don&#39;t expect that of you, my love...  But, what...  for heaven&#39;s sake! what are we talking about, dearest??  I don&#39;t have anything going on with that woman.  I don&#39;t even know her!  And as for those mysterious phone calls...  Mario Calderón made those mysterious phone calls. </p><p></p><p>Armando:  Look, what&#39;s happening is that Mario Calderón met this woman in Buenos Aires.  The subject of EcoModa came up, she was very interested - that&#39;s all.  He called me to set up an appointment.  Why?  Because she&#39;s coming to the Bogotá Fashion show and is interested in finding strategic associates to ally with her company in the United States.  Look, it&#39;s very simple:  Mario Calderón is going to come here tomorrow.  If things don&#39;t work out between this lady and us, then there won&#39;t be any deal and Mario Calderón will introduce her to other potential business associates.  The thing is, I couldn&#39;t tell you about this because...  because I know you detest Mario Calderón.  But, see? note that it is NOT another woman, it is not another woman!  It&#39;s my ex-friend Mario Calderón. </p><p>Betty:  That&#39;s worse...  Mario Calderón is as bad as you having 100 women at the same time.  And since when do you tell a man &#39;I love you, I miss you...?&#39;</p><p>Armando:  You... you were listening to me?  You were spying on me?</p><p>Betty:    I&#39;m sorry, Armando.  But I couldn&#39;t help overhearing your conversation.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m telling you I hate all this....</p><p>Armando:  No, no, no, it&#39;s just I think I can tell a man that I love him and I miss him, especially if that man, if that guy was my best friend, my only life-long friend.  I think that I can speak like that with him, that I have that right...</p><p>Betty:  And do you still esteem him?  After you kicked him out - literally - for having read my diary, for having made a joke of it and of my privacy? after all the pain he caused?</p><p></p><p>Armando:  Well, my love, you see?  That&#39;s exactly why I didn&#39;t want to bring this up.  That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want to discuss this.  Because I don&#39;t want you to have to remember all that, to suffer all over again.  Look, in any case Mario Calderón asked for my forgiveness [Beth:  altho he definitely should ask Armando to forgive him, the person he <em>really</em> ought to be apologizing to is Betty...!].  From his best friend.  No, I don&#39;t hate him, I don&#39;t hate him.  But he&#39;s not indispensable for me either.  I can go on living with him as I have done so far [since we married].  I, I...  Do you know why?  Because the only fundamental thing, the only sacred thing, and the only important things in my life are you and my daughter.  They&#39;re the only things I have, my love.  I wouldn&#39;t know how to live without you both.  I wouldn&#39;t know what to do in life, with my life...  And you know what?   If Mario Calderón&#39;s coming here is going to make you suffer, then no matter how wonderful the deal is, I am not going to take it.  I would rather he leave, that he never appear, ever.  <Armando takes Betty&#39;s face in his hands...>  The only thing I want to be very clear between us is that there will never be another woman, ever - she doesn&#39;t exist.  They kiss...  Monster, don&#39;t think bad things - don&#39;t...  </p><p>Armando leaves.</p><p>Hugo arrives with his cortège of models and Armando comes out of his office to ask that Hugo please participate in the meeting they will be having with Daniel.  Hugo declines.  Armando berates him for bringing his dog to work and Hugo retorts that <em>he</em> doesn&#39;t complain about Armando&#39;s bringing Betty to the office every day.  Hugo and his models then begin to comment on how much Armando has changed since he got married - one of the models says he&#39;s unfriendly and never greets any of them.  Hugo says it&#39;s almost as if Armando were gay...  Armando is not at all pleased by this discussion.  Another model remarks that he doesn&#39;t wear his wedding ring on his hand but rather around his neck [Beth:  note, the word used here for &#39;wedding ring&#39; can also mean &#39;shackle&#39;].  Hugo adds that he is waiting for Armando to have his first extra-marital affair, since he is convinced that Armando hasn&#39;t changed in the least.    Freddy arrives with invitations to the Bogotá Fashion show and hands them to Hugo and Armando.  Armando says he&#39;s not going as he has too much to do, and Hugo adds that Armando only goes out when he&#39;s got permission to do so from his in-laws...</p><p>Freddy is in Reception, where he asks Mariana to let him have some flowers from her desk so he can hand them out.  A female employee appears and he hands her some of the flowers; Mariana bawls the employee out for flirting with Freddy while reminding him he&#39;s engaged.  The employee retorts that the one who is flirting is Freddy, not she.</p><p>Freddy goes up to the Executive floor and gives flowers to Sandra and to Aura María.  He then tells Aura María they will go out to dinner that night - they will eat hot dogs and French fries, since Freddy&#39;s dinners out are on a limited budget.  Aura María is tired of this and says so.  They have the same argument as always - Freddy says in that case they will have hamburgers; Aura María starts calling him "Jabón Contreras" again [Beth:  ?? not sure i can translate this...  "jabón" means &#39;soap,&#39; "Contreras" is a normal last name -Freddy&#39;s last name, in fact- but in this case i think she&#39;s using it also as a play on the verb "contraer," which means &#39;to contract...&#39;  i think she&#39;s implying he&#39;s a double-dealer, someone who promises something and then tries to weasel out of it] and tells him she&#39;s tired of waiting to get married.  She heads for the bathroom, crying.  Bertha, Sofía and Sandra attack Freddy and begin to bawl him out for being so slippery and for keeping Aura María waiting for so long.  He calls them a pack of hyenas, a gaggle of sisters-in-law, witches, busy-bodies.  They continue the argument until they wear him down and convince him if he doesn&#39;t act soon he will lose Aura María, whereupon he departs with the promise that he will return with musicians and an engagement ring for Aura María.  </p><p>Sandra, Bertha y Sofía go to tell Betty the news about the marriage proposal and Freddy&#39;s plans to bring musicians.  Betty asks them not to do this during business hours since Daniel is going to be attending the meeting.  They reply that it will take place at 6p.  Sandra gives Betty an invitation to the Bogotá Fashion show and Betty says she&#39;s not going but if Armando wants to go by himself, he should go ahead...  She then tells Sandra the news about Calderón, that he&#39;ll also be at the Bogotá Fashion show.  Sandra seems pleased to hear that her ex-boss has reappeared and tells Betty that&#39;s good - it wasn&#39;t about a woman.  Betty remarks to her that there&#39;s nothing worse than one&#39;s husband&#39;s best friend.  Sandra replies that she can&#39;t speak as to that, not being married and never having had a boyfriend, lover, or even a ghost.  They also tell Inés the news about the engagement plans, and Inés says she will help by loaning an outfit to Aura María before Freddy arrives [to propose].</p><p>The elevator doors open to reveal the Prince Of Darkness, Daniel Valencia [Merci:  but how handsome he is!].  He encounters Aura María coming tearfully out of the bathroom.  He asks her why she&#39;s in such a state, if it&#39;s something personal or if it has to do with work.  She, the idiot, replies that it&#39;s personal.  He then tells her that she should plan these things better - cry before or after work, or during her lunch break, since he can&#39;t imagine what such behaviour must be costing the company.  The rest of the women say that nothing good can be going on, since Daniel always comes to stir things up.   </p><p>Daniel goes into the conference room to meet with Betty, Armando, Gutiérrez and Nicolás [Merci:  Gutiérrez continues to be as especially annoying as always -and now he practically doesn&#39;t speak Spanish at all!].  Daniel complains that Armando and Betty don&#39;t want to sell the company, they don&#39;t want to cut costs.  That being the case, he continues, the only alternative is to lay off some employees.  Betty and Armando tell him that that is not an option.  Armando reminds Daniel they are already working with a skeleton staff of both employees and executives, that they&#39;d never hired anyone to replace either Marcela or Mario Calderón [Beth:  or Patsy-Pat!  not that she ever did anything but cost money, but still...].  Daniel states that he was not the one to exile his sister and that he would prefer it if she were there.  He then asks if one can utter the name "Calderón" in the company, and remarks that maybe they should pay Armando a salary at home [Merci:  OUCH!].  Betty replies that maybe that way Armando would earn more, since the executive salaries had been frozen for the past year.  Nicolás brings up the option of bringing in outside investors...  Daniel answers that this would take time they don&#39;t have, and tells Gutiérrez in English that “time is golden."  Betty and Armando exchange glances...</p><p>A trio of guitarists arrives in Reception and Mariana calls the rest of the gang to ask what to do.  Of course, this is a problem since Daniel is still on the premises.  Mariana says the musicians can&#39;t stay in Reception and tells the Cartel that they need to hide the trio somewhere.  Bertha asks Inesita to distract Aura María and the musicians head upstairs, a bit put out because they want to start playing even though they&#39;ve been asked not to.  Then Wilson calls to say that Freddy&#39;s arrived.  They send Bertha to eavesdrop on the meeting and find out what&#39;s going on, and she returns with the information that it&#39;s running long.</p><p>In the conference room, Armando says that he is not going to accept Daniel&#39;s proposal.  Bertha continues to keep her "radar" on and manages to hear them discussing cutting back on personnel.  Daniel states that if they don&#39;t lay people off, he will sell off his shares as will the minority shareholders, and Betty and Armando will lose control of the company.  He stands and tells Gutiérrez they will meet to review the employee roster for layoffs [Beth:  not to ruin the story here, but since when does a shareholder or even a partner, i.e. Daniel, get to hire and fire employees and dictate policy in a company in which he does not hold an executive position??  Betty and Armando should&#39;ve shut him down right there, and told him unless he wanted to give up whatever job he currently has to come take Mario or Marcela&#39;s place, the most he is permitted to do is state his opinion and vote, when the matter comes up for a vote...].</p><p>Daniel leaves and sees the musicians.  He asks Bertha what is going on.  She -another idiot- explains, and Daniel starts to tell her that it&#39;s obvious that they don&#39;t have very much work to do, insinuating that her job is in danger.  Before the elevator doors close, Bertha, who is eating some potato chips, offers him some.  He refuses them and congratulates her on her diet:  Every day she&#39;s getting fatter...</p><p>Freddy is outside, really giving the eye to a woman passing by, and asking himself if maybe he&#39;s too young to get married.  Wilson asks him if he&#39;s sure he wants to put a leash around his neck; Freddy says yes, he is.  Daniel comes out and asks Freddy if he knows what he has to give a wife to keep her happy.  Freddy, joining the collection of idiots replying to Daniel&#39;s questions, replies one needs to give her love, tenderness, and fidelity.  Daniel says no, one needs to give her jewels, clothes, houses, vacations, cars... and hints that Freddy&#39;s job is rather ephemeral, although Freddy doesn&#39;t take his meaning.</p><p>Freddy arrives on the Executive Floor.  Aura María and Inesita appear (the rest of the Cartel is in the bathroom looking for the things for the party - apparently they are still using Bertha&#39;s hideaway).  The trio of guitarists starts to sing "Novia Mía" (My Girlfriend), and Freddy kneels and asks Aura María to marry him.  The rest of the Cartel emerges from the bathroom as Aura María tells him of course she will.  Freddy launches into one of his large discourses and hasn&#39;t managed to put the ring on Aura María&#39;s finger when Bertha arrives crying that they&#39;re all going to be let go!  That news effectively ends the party.  Freddy rethinks things and says they can&#39;t get married after all since if they don&#39;t have jobs they won&#39;t have anything to live on.  Aura María runs off wailing, very like the sort of fuss Pupuchurra Jenny used to make...</p><p>Hugo and his cortège emerge from the workshop and head for the elevator, from which Wilson emerges, dressed in an earth-colored jacket and a sick yellow-green shirt.  Hugo does not bother to withhold his thoughts on the walking fashion accident, concluding by advising Wilson that he never again wear "civvies" but instead stick to wearing his uniform and "blacks" and nothing else.  They then revert to the subject of everyone&#39;s being let go...</p><p>In the conference room, Betty asks Nicolás to make a study of what it would cost to make the layoffs Daniel is demanding.  She emphasizes that she doesn&#39;t want the employees to know about this and says they will continue their discussion of this topic over a breakfast meeting somewhere away from the office.  Gutiérrez and Nicolás leave together to get to work - the two are now almost like a team.  They tell Bertha and Sofía they will be working late, and the women offer to stay late with them, but are told that won&#39;t be necessary.  The two men are sad to think they won&#39;t be able to go to the Bogotá Fashion show...  Bertha and Sofía offer to bring their bosses dinner, and Nicolás promptly orders enough food for ten people.  They head into their offices, and immediately come out and swap as they&#39;d each entered the other&#39;s office...</p><p>Betty&#39;s in her office reading the magazine article about Gabriela Garza when Armando comes in to ask if she&#39;s ready to leave.  She tells him she&#39;d like to resign as she doesn&#39;t want to be party to a massive layoff of personnel and especially if that includes the Cartel.  When they leave her office, they hear the members of the Cartel discussing the layoffs The pair tell the women that nothing&#39;s been decided yet and ask where they&#39;d heard the rumor.  Sofía points to Bertha, who tries to escape but is stopped by Armando.  She rather desperately says that the gossip seeks <em>her</em> out...  Arriving at the elevator they run into Wilson, who is helping Sandra pack her things in a box.  Betty and Armando repeat that no decision has been made and they should all go home to rest. </p><p>Bertha remarks that it&#39;s all very well for Betty and Armando, who already have everything, to tell the rest of them not to worry.  Aura María says she&#39;s going to go out to party that night, but Freddy immediately says tells her no.  They decide to use the executives&#39; invitations to go to the Bogotá Fashion show instead.  Inesita tells them they shouldn&#39;t, but as usual, the vote goes against her (although Wilson also is against the plan until he realizes that he can go too).</p><p>At Betty and Armando&#39;s apartment, she is in bed watching television when Camila&#39;s puppet, sounding a great deal like Armando, suddenly appears at the door.  The puppet tells Betty all about everything it did to get the baby ready for bed [Merci:  It&#39;s a cute, funny little scene.  Ana María Orozco must&#39;ve been laughing her head off!].  The puppet also says it&#39;s very tired, but asks Betty if she wants it to bring her a little something to eat.  Armando comes in to sit next to Betty, and together they watch Gabriela Garza being interviewed on TV.  Gabriela mentions her plans to invest in Colombian companies.  Betty tells Armando to speak with "them" [i.e., Gabriela and Dimples the Snake, er - Mario] and make a deal.  She (Betty) doesn&#39;t want to be an obstacle or hurt the company and its employees just because Calderón happens to be involved in the matter.  Armando tells her he doesn&#39;t want her to suffer all over again from having Calderón around.  She replies that she doesn&#39;t want to lose him, and he says she won&#39;t lose him [Merci:  I don&#39;t know if I mistook what I saw or not, but it looked as if our Dr. Mendoza had a little look on his face like those he used to get "before," as he was watching the models parade in their bathing suits on the television...].</p><p>As the episode ends, we see the Cartel, Wilson and Freddy arrive at the Bogotá Fashion show...</p><p>Advance for next week&#39;s episode:   The Cartel, Wilson and Freddy are at the Bogotá Fashion show.  Freddy -brilliant as always- meets Gabriela Garza and tells her he is the President of EcoModa.  We see Gabriela Garza and her American associate Kenneth Johnson go to EcoModa, which causes a huge problem since Freddy has to continue pretending he is the President... Meanwhile, Betty and the rest of the executives are at a breakfast meeting outside the office...</p>
