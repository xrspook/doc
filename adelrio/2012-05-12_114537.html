Although this paved the way for two explosive singles contests between the fierce foursome, when SmackDown came to a close, tensions had gone from explosive to absolutely nuclear.<br><br>On the May 7 edition of Raw SuperShow, Sheamus & Orton's tag team match against Jericho & Del Rio diverged down the road to incredible bedlam in John Laurinaitis’ office. (FULL RAW RESULTS) As a result, the General Manager of Raw and SmackDown changed the World Heavyweight Title Match at WWE Over the Limit into a Fatal 4-Way showdown. <br><br>Four days after that decision, SmackDown began with a grueling tag team rematch between the four fiery competitors, until an all-out brawl forced the referee to call for the bell and throw the contest out completely. That didn’t stop the action, however, as all four grapplers continued to fight, both inside and outside the ring, utilizing a street fight mentality that stood as a fitting appetizer to the uncontrollable free-for-all that will take place in the Fatal 4-Way Match in nine days.<br><br>In a tweet issued soon after, John Laurinaitis’ Executive Administrator Eve announced, on behalf of the EVP, that – because the match's outcome was "unacceptable" – the four Superstars would each face one of their pay-per-view opponent in singes competition later on the show: The Viper would take on The Mexican Aristocrat while The Great White would battle the first-ever Undisputed WWE Champion.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-11/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-11/results</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Fatal 4-Way combatants push Friday night 'Over the Limit'</strong><br><br>BY Michael Burdick May 11, 2012<br><br><strong>Randy Orton def. Alberto Del Rio by Disqualification</strong><br><br>For the second time of the night, Randy Orton stepped into the ring to face Alberto Del Rio, just nine days before they will battle as part of the Fatal 4-Way World Heavyweight Championship Match at WWE Over the Limit. (MATCH PREVIEW)<br><br>Despite constant attacks on The Viper’s shoulder throughout the match, the resilient nine-time World Champion rebounded and prepared to put his crafty foe down for the three-count.<br><br>But, before Orton could attempt to close the deal, Ricardo Rodriguez leaped at him from the top rope, only to receive an RKO in mid-air for his trouble. Though this interference gave the serpentine Superstar a victory by disqualification, the opportunistic Del Rio quickly hurled his adversary into the steel ring post before applying the cross armbreaker. Although the fact that The Mexican Aristocrat wasn't able to fully lock in his signature maneuver ultimately saved WWE’s Apex Predator, the damage on Orton’s arm was evident.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-11/results/page-6">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-11/results/page-6</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Fatal 4-Way combatants push Friday night 'Over the Limit'<br></strong><br>BY Michael Burdick May 11, 2012<br><br><strong>Chris Jericho def. World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus by Disqualification<br></strong><br>After fighting to the ropes in order to break his foe’s Walls of Jericho submission maneuver in the height of their main event showdown, Sheamus sent the first-ever Undisputed WWE Champion over the top rope and crashing down to the ringside floor.<br><br>Moments later, Alberto Del Rio emerged, looking to make a statement as he attacked the fallen Jericho and threw him into the steel ring steps. He managed to get the jump on The Celtic Warrior, locking him in the cross armbreaker.<br><br>Randy Orton soon joined the party, seeking payback on Del Rio for their altercation earlier in the evening. But, while he fell into an argument with The Great White over which one of them had the right to attack his target more, Jericho reemerged from nowhere, delivering the Codebreaker to the war-torn Del Rio. Then Orton and Sheamus each asserted his own ground by hitting the RKO and the Brogue Kick on Del Rio respectively.<br><br>What will happen when all four competitors are unleashed on each other in the Fatal 4-Way World Title Match at WWE Over the Limit? </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-11/results/page-10">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-11/results/page-10</a> <br></p>
