However, it was noted that the match may not necessarily be for the World Heavyweight Championship currently held by Del Rio.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/360988831.shtml">http://nodq.com/wwe/360988831.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Big Update on WrestleMania 29 Plans for Alberto Del Rio and Dolph Ziggler</strong></p><p>By Sharon Glencross (Featured Columnist) on January 23, 2013</p><p>Is there a drastic change of plans for the WrestleMania card underway?</p><p>As most of us already know, Sheamus vs. a newly turned Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship has reportedly (via WrestlingInc) been the plan for a while now. It looked like current World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio and Mr. Money in the Bank Dolph Ziggler would be left out in the cold...or at least relegated to a midcard role on the April 7 event.</p><p>However, in this week's (subscribers-only) Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Dave Meltzer gives an update on the plans for Ziggler and Del Rio, noting that there is currently talk that the two will face each other on the card and that the championship may even be on the line:</p><blockquote><p>A match that was talked about for Mania right now is Del Rio vs. Ziggler, who were both not among those listed in the original top matches. At this point if they don’t do a title switch at Rumble or Elimination Chamber, it could be the world title match.</p></blockquote><p>While WWE may be altering their long-term plans with the proposed Ziggler/Del Rio match, it may be, on paper at least, a good way to go.<br></p><p>Come on, is anyone truly eager to see Sheamus vs. Orton?</p><p>Sure, the stagnant Orton may be reinvigorated by a potential heel turn, but his star power is simply not what it once was, and it remains to be seen if the company can ever truly trust him again following his second drug suspension last May.</p><p>At some point you have to ask: Why waste so much time and energy on someone who, per the company's wellness policy, will have to be fired if he fails one more test?</p><p>For his part, Sheamus hasn't really taken off with the fans as a top babyface. Personally, I blame whoever is giving him those lame comedy promos to say on television. Sadly, the Irish star has basically tuned into a more sophomoric version of Cena at this point.</p><p>Ziggler and Del Rio, meanwhile, are fresh and up-and-coming stars, who both deserve a decent run on top and could work a great feud with each other if given the chance.</p><p>It also makes little sense to strip Del Rio of the championship (to either Sheamus or Orton) so soon after he won it, especially if WWE really are intent on making him their next major star.<br></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1498463-big-update-on-wrestlemania-29-plans-for-alberto-del-rio-and-dolph-ziggler">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1498463-big-update-on-wrestlemania-29-plans-for-alberto-del-rio-and-dolph-ziggler</a></p>
