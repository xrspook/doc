THE FEUD OF 2012?</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-12-19 23:06:29</p><p>We are live from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and your announcers are Jerry ‘Is this the Murphy Rec Center’ Lawler and Michael ‘Change the Audio Channel’ Cole.</p><p>We begin with a drumroll and CM Punk introduces the result of TLC through John Laurinaitis. Punk asks if the winner of the main event was Alberto Del Rio, The Miz, or the Best Wrestler in the World? The winner was . . . CM Punk and he comes out. Punk comes to the ring and does a victory lap in the ring.</p><p>Punk says that much to the chagrin of Clown Shoes Laurinaitis and with tables, ladders, and Ricardo Rodriguez flying around, Punk says that he managed to retain his WWE Title. Punk says that he is beat up and sore. Punk says that this is a title that people did not think he would hold.</p><p>Punk turns his attention to the United States Championship Match. Time for a ‘Who Won the Match’ Quiz. Was it Mr. Ziggles or was it Zack Ryder. Punk gives us a spoiler and brings out Zack Ryder. Cole makes sure to minimize the title win (but it will probably pale in comparison to what will probably happen in a few).</p><p>Punk says that he is saving the biggest for last. There was a Chairs Match between two heavyweight monsters for the World Heavyweight Title Match. Time for a Drumroll. Was it Mark Henry or was it Big Show? Punk mentions that Show won, but then we have the big spoiler when the unthinkable happened. Who walked out of Tables, Ladders, and Chairs with the World Heavyweight Championship? Punk introduces Daniel Bryan. You can only imagine what Cole is saying.</p><p>They soak in the chants for Daniel Bryan.</p><p>Punk figures that if there was any city that would appreciate this scene, it would be Philadelphia. A city so entrenched in pro wrestling history. Punk wonders who would think that Punk and Daniel Bryan who met 10 years ago at the Murphy Rec Center would be in the same WWE ring as the WWE Champion and the World Champion.</p><p>Punk lets Ryder join in the fun. Ryder gives a Woo Woo Woo for the fans.</p><p>Punk says that this is crazy.</p><p>Punk reminds everyone that he has no filter but tonight is about Zack Ryder and Daniel Bryan. Guys who worked up from the bottom and made it to the top. Punk says that these are guys who live wrestling. The fans have brought them to this level.</p><p>Punk says that he wants to hear from the two new champions.</p><p>Zack goes first. He says that he can’t believe it and he had to ask his dad to make sure that he is the United States Champion.</p><p>Bryan takes the mic and Punk says that people never expected him to be WWE Champion. Bryan says that there are people who never thought he should be in WWE, like Michael Cole. Bryan tells Cole that not only is he here, he is a champion. Not only that, but he is the World Champion.</p><p>Bryan says that this experience is unbelievable. . .</p><p>The Miz comes out and he is joined by Dolph Ziggler and Alberto Del Rio. They make their way to the ring and it looks like there is going to be a rumble . . . tonight.</p><p>Ryder takes care of ZIggler while Punk takes care of Miz and Bryan takes care of Del Rio before they get in the ring.</p><p>Del Rio, Ziggler and Miz plan things out and Ryder with a flip dive onto Ziggler. Miz and Del Rio send Ryder into the ring steps. Bryan and Punk chase Del Rio, Miz, and Ziggler up the ramp.</p><p>John Laurinaitis comes out and he stops them from doing anything more. John points out that as the general manager, he is going to make a six man tag match in the main event. John says that it is his Christmas present to the WWE Universe.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: Miz, Alberto Del Rio, and Dolph Ziggler with Vickie Guerrero versus Daniel Bryan, CM Punk, and Zack Ryder</strong></p><p>Punk and Miz start things off and Punk with a side head lock and shoulder tackle followed by a near fall. Punk with an arm drag into an arm bar. Bryan tags in and Bryan with a drop kick after leap frogs and he gets a near fall. Ziggler tags in and Bryan with a drop toe hold and then he drives Ziggler’s knees into the mat. Ryder tags in and they hit a double hip toss on Ziggler and Ziggler goes to the floor. Del Rio and Miz follow Ziggler to the floor. Bryan teases the suicide dive and Ryder with a flip dive onto Del Rio and Miz. Bryan with a running knee to Ziggler off the apron. Punk with a cross body from the top onto Del Rio and Miz on the floor as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Bryan with a flying clothesline to Miz followed by kicks to the chest. Miz avoids a kick and Miz with a DDT for a near fall. Del Rio tags in and he kicks Bryan in the ribs. Del Rio kicks Bryan in the ribs. Del Rio with a snap mare and drop kick to the back of the neck for a near fall.</p><p>Ziggler tags in and he punches Bryan followed by a snap mare and a reverse chin lock. Bryan gets to his feet and Bryan with elbows but Ziggler with a clothesline and he gets a near fall. Ziggler tags in Miz and Miz kicks Bryan followed by a punch and a kick to the head for a near fall.</p><p>Del Rio tags in and he punches Bryan but Bryan with European uppercuts. Del Rio with an Irish whip and a step up enzuigiri to the shoulder. Del Rio with more kicks to Bryan and then Del Rio works on the arm and applies an arm bar. Bryan with punches but Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall.</p><p>Ziggler tags in and he punches Bryan. Ziggler with punches but he runs into a boot from Bryan when he charges into the corner. Ryder tags in and he hits a running forearm and clothesline. Ryder drives Ziggler’s head into the mat and then he hits a running forearm followed by the running boot to the head.

Del Rio tags in and he kicks Ryder followed by an Irish whip. Del Rio charges into the corner but Ryder with a back body drop to the floor.</p><p>Ryder struggles to make the tag and he tags in Punk and he hits a springboard clothesline on Miz followed by another clothesline and a neck breaker. Punk with a running knee into the corner followed by a bulldog and then he slams Miz. Punk goes up top for the Savage elbow drop and he hits it. Punk gets a near fall and then he locks in the Anaconda Vice but Ziggler breaks it up. Ziggler and Ryder fight on the floor and Ryder with a clothesline.</p><p>Bryan and Del Rio tag in and Bryan with a missile drop kick.

Del Rio sets for the cross arm breaker but Del Rio takes too long. Bryan applies the LeBell Lock and Del Rio taps out. (and Michael Cole cries)</p><p>Winners: Zack Ryder, CM Punk, and Daniel Bryan</p><p>The three champions celebrate after the match and they go to the fans. We go to credits.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/64324/ongoing-wwe-raw-report-you-could-almost-hear-coles-heart-break-champs-start-off-the-show-tlc-rematch.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/64324/ongoing-wwe-raw-report-you-could-almost-hear-coles-heart-break-champs-start-off-the-show-tlc-rematch.html?p=1</a></p>
