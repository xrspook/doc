Two nights of nonstop Ring of Honor action: Dearborn, MI and Dayton, OH. Plus, our ROH TV cameras will be rolling in Dearborn because this is now a ROAD RAGE television taping!</p><p>JUST ADDED TO DAYTON ON JANUARY 31st:</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>WILL FERRARA VS. THE ROMANTIC TOUCH</li></ul><p>One of the hottest young talents in professional wrestling takes on the always amorous, always mysterious Romantic Touch in Dayton! Will Ferrara has promised to make 2015 "his" year - and participating in the 2015 Top Prospect Tournament plus battling some of the mainstays of the ROH roster is a great way to start.</p><p>Determined to be taken seriously as a competitor, Ferrara looks at every single match as an opportunity to prove himself. Meanwhile, The Romantic Touch looks at every match as an opportunity to woo some ladies in the front row - while showing off his capabilities. These two athletes might have very different attitudes, but they both want to pull out a win in Dayton!</p><p>WINTER WARRIORS TOUR (ROAD RAGE) January 30th, 2015 Dearborn, Michigan</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>ROH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MICHAEL BENNETT w/ MARIA KANELLIS VS. JAY BRISCOE (c)</li></ul><p>ROH World Champion Jay Briscoe informed Nigel McGuinness that he would face anyone for his championship in Dearborn and this just in! Jay Briscoe is to defend the ROH World Championship against The Kingdom’s Michael Bennett. The Kingdom has been making life miserable for Jay and his brother, Mark. Briscoe successfully defended his championship this past weekend on ROH Television against Bennett’s Kingdom cohort, Matt Taven. As Briscoe was celebrating his victory, Bennett took the opportunity to strike Jay Briscoe with the “Title of Love”. Not only will Briscoe be looking to successfully defend the ROH World Championship but also regain possession of that “Title of Love”, which was previously Briscoe’s “Real World Title”. Can Bennett withstand the “Briscoe brand of whoop ass”, make history by being the first person to beat Jay Briscoe in over two years and become ROH World Champion? With the Kingdom’s presence looming, the odds may not be in Briscoes favor. What tricks will Maria Kanellis have up her sleeve? Jay Briscoe did not become a two-time ROH World Champion by accident! He will be ready and the fans of Dearborn should expect some fireworks!</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>ROH WORLD TELEVISION CHAMPIONSHIP JAY LETHAL w/ TRUTH MARTINI VS. RODERICK STRONG</li></ul><p>Since splitting from The Decade, Roderick Strong has sworn to refocus himself and climb back to the top. Strong is an absolute cornerstone of ROH and one of only two Triple Crown Champions in the history of Ring of Honor. In other words, Strong knows better than most what it takes to be the ROH World Television Champion. But to reclaim that glory, he's going to have to topple the seemingly unstoppable Jay Lethal.</p><p>Lethal just snagged the record for longest reigning TV Champion in ROH history and ever since winning the title at last year's Supercard of Honor. Absolutely NO ONE has been able to slow his success. Of course, Lethal acquired more than just the championship on the day he began his reign. He also secured the services of Truth Martini, who has played an unarguably significant role in keeping that belt around Jay Lethal's waist.</p><p>Long before he was associated with Lethal, Truth Martini served as a guide for a different client: Roderick Strong! Does this give Lethal an advantage because his current manager is intimately familiar with the strategies his challenger? Or can Roderick Strong anticipate the less than honorable tactics of Truth Martini and neutralize his interference?</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>ACH VS. ALBERTO EL PATRON</li></ul><p>One of the undisputedly most exciting athletes in the history of ROH, ACH is fueled by heart and motivation. And what's more motivational than the opportunity to take on an international champion with years of global success? 2014 was full of huge matches for ACH, including TV and World Title opportunities and a show-stealing performance in the year's CHAMPIONS VS. ALL STARS bout. Even if he didn't come out holding gold, ACH showed the world that he is a force in ROH - now and for the future.</p><p>And how do you prepare for a match against ACH? El Patrón has traveled the world wrestling professionally for a decade and a half. He's trained extensively in Mexico and Japan. But we can guarantee he's never faced anyone quite like ACH! That's because night after night ACH thrills crowds with athletic feats unlike anyone else in this sport. Can El Patrón utilize his extensive technical and submission background to keep ACH grounded?</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>MATT TAVEN VS. MATT SYDAL</li></ul><p>Reborn Matt Sydal is without a doubt one of the most exciting athletes in history to grace Ring of Honor. Matt Taven, in his time with Ring of Honor has proven himself to also be a top-flight ROH star. ROH fans in Dearborn will see these two special athletes face off for the very first time. These two are both well known for their willingness to take flight to do battle. Can Sydal soar higher and score a big victory? Can The Kingdom’s self-proclaimed “Must See” bring down the gravity-defying superstar?</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>TYSON DUX VS. TOMMASO CIAMPA</li></ul><p>ROH fans will also see The Sicilian Psychopath Tommaso Ciampa take on the intense Tyson Dux. Ciampa currently has his sights Jay Briscoe’s prized ROH World Championship, but Dux brings an element that Ciampa should not overlook. Dux, no stranger to ROH fans is a training partner and mentor to current Ciampa nemesis “Unbreakable” Michael Elgin. What role has Elgin played in preparing Dux for his biggest match to date in ROH? Will Ciampa’s erratic state of mind allow him to focus on the task at hand or can Dux capitalize and score a victory?</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>TADARIUS THOMAS VS. JIMMY JACOBS</li></ul><p>Ring of Honor fans saw the rise of The Decade in 2014 with Jimmy Jacobs at the forefront. Seen as the devious mastermind, Jacobs conspired with fellow Decade cohort BJ Whitmer to introduce “young boys” to The Decade. Tadarius Thomas would join the group, seeing this a way to further his career. After dealing with several months of humiliation, Thomas decided he didn’t agree with The Decade’s philosophy and left the group. Tadarius recently announced that he is returning to another passion, Mixed Martial Arts. He recently declared that he wanted his last match in Ring of Honor to be in his hometown of Dearborn, MI. His opponent on this night will be the despicable Jimmy Jacobs. Jacobs would love to ruin Thomas’ final night in ROH, as well as make him suffer for turning his back on The Decade! These two will collide with a lot more than personal pride on the line.</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>MICHAEL ELGIN VS. MARK BRISCOE</li></ul><p>Ever since losing the Ring of Honor World Championship last September, “Unbreakable” Michael Elgin has been surrounded by a storm of controversy. Through it all, his goal has remained the same: to become ROH World Champion for a 2nd time. That route has now taken a personal direction as he has been signed to face Mark Briscoe.</p><p>Mark is not here to fight his brother’s battles, nor attempt to protect Elgin from getting to Jay. If you have an issue with Jay, however, history has shown that you will also have an issue with Mark. He is one of the most decorated competitors in Ring of Honor history and has championship aspirations of his own. Could the human powder keg, Michael Elgin, cross a line and escalate tensions? Mark Briscoe has no intention of being stepping stone so he will have definite plans on derailing Elgin’s championship goals. Two of the best in Ring of Honor meet live in Dearborn, MI when "Unbreakable" Michael Elgin faces Mark Briscoe. You will not want to miss it!</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>BJ WHITMER VS. HANSON</li></ul><p>The Bully versus the Beard! The Decade’s BJ Whitmer long known as a bully with no boundaries will face off with “War Beard” Hanson! Whitmer takes pride in being able to mentally break opponents while Hanson has shown no signs of weakness since his arrival in ROH. Whitmer will without a doubt have his Decade compatriots close by and this should be a major cause for concern. Can Whitmer stall Hanson’s rise to superstardom in ROH? We will find out for sure on Friday Night January 30, 2015!</p><p>WINTER WARRIORS TOUR Saturday, January 31st, 2015 Dayton, Ohio 45409</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>MATT SYDAL & ACH VS. MARK & JAY BRISCOE</li></ul><p>To the delight of the ROH fans, Sydal & ACH are stepping right into the fire against "Dem Boys". The combination of aerial styles that both Sydal & ACH bring could be considered revolutionary. There has likely never been a duo that has defied gravity with the ease displayed by these two. The Briscoes got a taste of their offense, as they were also part of the Tag Wars 2014 Finals, so they won’t be total strangers. Could that offense prove to be kryptonite against ass-kicking, smash mouth style of The Briscoes?</p><p>In Dayton, on the “Winter Warriors” Tour, it’s the legacy of the greatest against a team looking to create their own legacy. Can Sydal & ACH score the win and prove they are worthy of an ROH World Tag Team Title opportunity? Can the Briscoes do the same with a win here as they reunite to prove they take pride in the legacy they have created?</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>ALBERTO EL PATRON VS. RODERICK STRONG</li></ul><p>You can't come to Ring of Honor without wrestling "Mr. ROH"! Cocky and confident, Roderick Strong considers himself the most loyal and iconic star in ROH. When you look at his accomplishments, it's really difficult to argue against him! Roderick Strong might talk a lot of trash but he also has the resume to back it up. It's often stated that Roderick Strong is the "gatekeeper" of ROH. He is the standard for excellence for anyone who hopes to compete in Ring of Honor - and he has been guarding the ranks for years. Strong, only the second Triple Crown Champion in ROH history, has made major claims that 2015 will be his year. He is motivated by a deep desire to prove that he the very best in the world, inside that ring. Having faced off with every major name in Ring of Honor history, from Bryan Danielson to Samoa Joe, Strong is no stranger to top level competition. With his eyes on winning gold in ROH in 2015, a win over the international superstar El Patrón, could put him in top contention to any championship.</p><p>The Mexican Aristocrat, El Patrón requested nothing but the very best from ROH matchmaker Nigel McGuinness. This match-up with Strong gives him not only one of the best today, but one of the best in Ring of Honor history! With a storied legacy of his own in Mexico, Japan and the US, can Alberto defeat “Mr. ROH” to add to it? The fans of Dayton will find out for sure.</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>HANSON VS. MATT TAVEN</li></ul><p>In a battle of the last two ROH Top Prospect Tournament winners, The Kingdom’s Matt Taven will take on War Machine’s Hanson! Hanson is someone the fans of Ring of Honor have taken to in droves, while the man who calls himself “Must See” has purposely angered and looked down on those very same fans. Hanson is a brute who has brought a level of intensity that is unmatched, while Taven brings a brash confidence and a nearly unequaled aerial style. Hanson is currently is on a record setting pace as a solo competitor. A win over Taven would further propel him into the stratosphere as a top contender. Taven is no stranger to Hanson as they faced off in New England in their formative years. He will certainly bring his “A” game to Dayton in hopes of derailing the bearded warrior.</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>MICHAEL BENNETT w/ MARIA KANELLIS VS. TOMMASO CIAMPA</li></ul><p>In what could be a ROH World Championship match, Taven’s fellow Kingdom member Michael Bennett will be in action, taking on “The Sicilian Psychopath” Tommaso Ciampa. While Maria Kanellis will have Bennett and the “Title of Love” ready, Ciampa is as focused as can be on securing the ROH World title. Bennett has a shot at the ROH World Championship the night before in Dearborn, MI so he could possibly be the champ on the 31st. Remember, Ciampa has a “zero tolerance policy” hanging over his head and The Kingdom is well aware of this. Could Ciampa be set up or will Bennett fall to the blazing hot “Sicilian Psychopath”?</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>MICHAEL ELGIN VS. CHRIS DICKINSON</li></ul><p>In professional wrestling chances are often given to guys who truly deserve them. “Dirty Daddy” Chris Dickinson definitely falls into that category. Unfortunately for Dickinson his opportunity comes against one of the hottest stars in Ring of Honor, “Unbreakable” Michael Elgin. Dickinson is a well-traveled, hard hitting competitor making his Ring of Honor debut against a former ROH World Champion although potentially at the wrong time. The always controversial Elgin has been steamrolling competition recently with his eye on an eventual match-up for the ROH World title. Could Dickinson shock the world and make a huge statement in Ring of Honor? “Unbreakable” is not coming to lose and for Dickinson, this is makes for a scary opportunity.</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>JIMMY JACOBS & BJ WHITMER VS. AEROFORM (LOUIS LYNDON & FLIP KENDRICK)</li></ul><p>The Decade’s Jimmy Jacobs & BJ Whitmer will take on the up-and-coming team of Louis Lyndon& Flip Kendrick, collectively known as Aeroform. Not only are Jacobs and Whitmer two-time former Ring of Honor Tag Team Champions, they are also two of the most devious individuals when it comes to taking the measure of young wrestlers. Aeroform is a gravity-defying tag team that could make a big impact by beating former tag team champions in their ROH debut. It’s the rough veterans of ROH against the high-flying newcomers looking to prove they belong.</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li>PLUS ROH WORLD TELEVISION CHAMPION JAY LETHAL w/ TRUTH MARTINI</li></ul><p>You still have time to be there LIVE!
