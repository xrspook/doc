Booker announces Antonio Cesaro vs. Randy Orton. The Rock will be in this very ring tonight. Also Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio. Show comes out and confronts Booker. He gets a microphone and says his match with Del Rio is because Booker T has a personal vendetta against him. Big Show says Del Rio is only getting the match because they're in Miami and Del Rio is Latino. There are no more Latino heroes, no more Irish heroes, no Viper heroes. Del Rio runs out and attacks Big Show and clears him out of the ring. Loud chant for Del Rio.</p><p>Show vs. Del Rio for later tonight will be a Last Man Standing match.</p><p>Show vs. Del Rio in a Last Man Standing match is next. Del Rio came out in a Lamborghini. Big Show put him through a table on the outside. Del Rio starts using a chair on Show in the ring. Lots of back and forth. Show hits a choke slam and Del Rio gets up after 7. Outside the ring, Big Show slams Del Rio through the ringside barricade. Del Rio gets up after a 9 count and the crowd goes nuts. Back in the ring, Big Show nails Del Rio with the WMD knockout punch. Del Rio makes the count by rolling out of the ring at the last second and standing up. Big Show tries to hit Del Rio with ring steps but it backfired and he hits himself. Del Rio hits Big Show with the ring steps 3 times and Big Show is hurt. Del Rio turns the announcers table onto Big Show and gets the 10 count for the win. And new World Heavyweight Champion - Alberto Del Rio! Del Rio celebrates in the ring and in the crowd.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0108/559317/the-rock/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0108/559317/the-rock/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Complete WWE Smackdown Taping Results (SPOILERS)</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 01.08.2013</p><p>Introductions for Smackdown were made. Lilian Garcia came out to what seemed like one of her own songs and she received a good reaction. JBL followed, which sadly enough did not get much of a reaction. Wow, how wrestling has changed. Garcia asked everyone to look at the screen for a video.</p><p>Booker T came out and said this Smackdown would be better than Raw. He announced Antonio Cesaro vs. Randy Orton, The Rock in the ring (but not sure for what), and Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio in a last man standing match.</p><p>Big Show entered and was not happy at all. Show got on the mic saying it was personal. He pointed out the high Latino population in Miami as the reason Del Rio is getting the opportunity and let us know there are no Latino heroes. Pretty funny. Show started roughing up Booker until Del Rio saved him. Del Rio handed Show a quick beat down and everyone walked away.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio defeated Big Show in a Last Man Standing match to win the World Hvt. Championship. Del Rio got a good pop. I guess Show was right. Good mix in the ring. Show quickly got a table and put Del Rio through it. Start the count. Up at 6. Bring on the chair. Del Rio got best of Show with the chair and then used a cool armbar that didn't work out to well. Del Rio went back to the offense. Show quickly recovered. Bring on another table.</p><p>Del Rio drop kick show though the table. Start the count. Show up at six. Del Rio put a sleeper hold on Show that didn't work too well either. Show chokeslammed Del Rio. Start the count. Up at nine. Show put Del Rio though the barricade. I don't know how, but Show got up at nine. Wow!!</p><p>Show performed the WMD on Del Rio, but Del Rio got up at six. Show tagged him with another WMD, but Del Rio got up at eight. Ricardo tried to help Del Rio and brought on the stairs. Show missed and went into the corner post. Show was stunned. Del Rio threw the stairs into Show twice. Show was still standing. Del Rio hit him three times with stairs. OMG moment. Show went down. Del Rio flipped the announcers' table on Show to start the count. Del Rio wins the belt.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/269164">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/269164</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
