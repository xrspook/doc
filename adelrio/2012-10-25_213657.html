They are stopped by Teddy Long because Teddy wants to know where they are going. Alberto says that Randy Orton chose Mark Henry because Orton did not think that he could beat the WWE Champion. Alberto says that he does not blame Orton and then he says that he has no reason to be here.</p><p>Teddy says that before Alberto gets his party started, he will wrestle Sheamus.</p><p>Teddy walks away from Alberto and Ricardo.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez versus Sheamus</strong></p><p>They lock up and Sheamus with a side head lock and shoulder tackle for a near fall.

Sheamus with a short arm clothesline for a near fall. Sheamus misses a charge into the turnbuckles and then Del Rio with a missile drop kick and then he punches Sheamus in the head and he kicks Sheamus.</p><p>Del Rio with an arm bar and he kicks the leg to take away Sheamus’ vertical base. Del Rio turns it into a key lock but Sheamus with punches to get out of the hold. Del Rio with a single arm buster and then he returns to the key lock. Sheamus with punches to Del Rio but Del Rio with a shot to the head.</p><p>Del Rio runs into an elbow and then Sheamus with a series of running double sledges and then he hits a pump handle power slam. Sheamus with a clothesline into the corner followed by a uranage back breaker for a near fall. Sheamus goes up top for the flying shoulder tackle but Ricardo gets on the apron. Sheamus punches Ricardo and while the referee was distracted, Christian crotches Sheamus.</p><p>Del Rio with the step up enzuigiri that sends Sheamus to the mat. Del Rio with a kick to the head and he gets the three count.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Christian picks up the spare and hits the spear on Sheamus.
