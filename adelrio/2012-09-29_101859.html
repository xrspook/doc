Recalling the embarrassment of his last World Title reign, which lasted 45 seconds, the giant stated that when the Superstar that defeated him, Daniel Bryan, lost that title in 18 seconds at WrestleMania, it was a true turning point in his career. He then stated, in no uncertain terms, that he was the one Superstar on the roster that could beat current World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus.</p><p>Big Show was soon interrupted by Randy Orton, the serpentine competitor that he would face in the SmackDown main event to try and become the No. 1 contender to The Great White’s championship gold at WWE Hell in a Cell. The Viper said that if The World’s Largest Athlete thought he would stand in between him and his 10th World Title, he would “not be standing for much longer.”</p><p>As the fierce adversaries contemplated whether the main event would see someone get “bit by the RKO or hit with a KO,” Alberto Del Rio emerged, demanding that — because he was “cheated” in his World Title Match at Night of Champions and “better than both Orton and Big Show combined” — both Superstars would be moving to the back of the line. But as The Mexican Aristocrat entered the ring, The Viper wasted no time hitting Del Rio with the RKO.<br></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-28/results-26054449">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-28/results-26054449</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Big Show def. Randy Orton – No. 1 Contender for the World Heavyweight Championship</strong></p><p> Before Randy Orton could face Big Show, he was attacked in the back by Alberto Del Rio, the Superstar he hit with the RKO at the start of the show. The Mexican Aristocrat then tried to take his prey’s place in the No. 1 Contender’s Match, only to be stopped by the now-injured Viper. After taking his attacker down, WWE’s Apex Predator insisted on facing the giant anyway, battling for the right to face World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus at WWE Hell in a Cell.</p><p>In the ensuing showdown, the courageous Orton attempted time and time again to overcome not only the fierce giant, but also his own injured midsection. The wrath that he had to endure for the majority of the contest was so vicious, that when he finally regrouped and countered the chokeslam to hit the RKO, he couldn’t seem to execute it fully. Possibly for this reason, Show kicked out of the dreaded finishing maneuver! The giant then hit two chokeslams for the huge win, making him the new No. 1 contender to The Great White’s World Title at WWE Hell on a Cell.</p><p>After the bell, following an argument with a fan, The World’s Largest Athlete returned to the ring and hit his fallen opponent with the WMD.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-28/results-26054449/page-8">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-28/results-26054449/page-8</a></p>
