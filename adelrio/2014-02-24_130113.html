Del Rio came out on crutches and said that due to Batista’s attack, he wasn’t able to compete. He then nailed him with a ctrutch he bought to the ring and disrobed to reveal his tights. He kept working him over with shots to the back and knees. He nailed Batista again and yelled for the bell.</p><p>Batista pulled himself to his feet and attacked Del Rio. The crowd was behind ADR and booing Batista. They were chanting, “Boo-Tista.”</p><p>Alberto tied up Batista in the ropes and used the armbar. He then began stomping the hell out of him. The crowd chanted for “Daniel Bryan”, I guess in protest of Batista being in the main event of Wrestlemania.</p><p>Del Rio cinched in an armbar. Now, the crowd was loudly chanting for CM Punk. Batista fired back but ADR snapped his arm with his knees. JBL acknowledged it was an unusual crowd cheering for ADR. A “Y2J” chant broke out.</p><p>Batista sent ADR into the corner shoulder-first. Batista nailed him with several shoulderblocks but was kicked down. ADR nailed a double stomp off the ropes. The crowd began chanting for “RVD.” ADR nailed a kick to the head for a two count, but Batista grabbed the bottom rope at the last second. Batista was covered again but kicked up. Now, it was a “We want Lesnar” chant.</p><p>Batista caught ADR with a spear and covered him for a two count. He worked over ADR but was caught with a backstabber. ADR missed a swanton and was nailed with a spinebuster. The crowd booed the hell out of that. ADR escaped a Batista Bomb attempt and kicked Batista in the head for a two count.</p><p>ADR called for the cross armbreaker but was shoved into the buckles and nailed with the Batista Bomb for the pin.</p><p>Your winner, Batista!</p><p>Well, it was something. It wasn’t good but it was something. It was probably too long for what they needed and the crowd just killed it.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=83779&p=3">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=83779&p=3</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>THE MAIN EVENT, THE WWE UNIVERSE HATES BATISTA...A LOT, THE WYATTS VS. THE SHIELD MADE THE SHOW WORTH THE PRICE, FOR SURE - ONGOING WWE ELIMINATION CHAMBER PPV BLOG</strong></p><p>By Dave Scherer on 2014-02-23 20:54:03</p><p>There wasn't all that much to talk about on the pre-game show. They talked about tonight's show and pushed the Network, exactly as they should have.</p><p>Batista comes out and we hear boos. Yep, clear as day. After his pyro, we hear cheers. Time for him to kill Alberto.</p><p>Alberto came out using a crutch and had a huge neckbrace. ADR says cuz Batista attacked him, he won't be able to compete and used the crutch to beat Batista's ass. The crowd seemed to like that. ADR has his gear on under the disguise. The crowd likes it, they are chanting SI SI SI. ADR called for the bell. Of course Batista came back and the crowd booed. ADR took control and the crowd loved it. Batista then got control and they chanted BOO TISTA. Get him out of the Mania main event Vince. Then they chanted Daniel Bryan. The for CM Punk. ... Batista got control, they booed. ADR back in control, they cheered. JBL said they were an unusual crowd. No they are the new crowd, deal. They then chanted Y2J and the announcers acknowledged it. Batista came back and I heard boring chants. He has to be asking, "What did I do?" RVD chants were next. Then it was we want Lesnar. Big Dave is big fail. ... Dave made his comeback with the spear and got a two, and a lot of boos. Another near fall, more boys. Terrible clotheline more boos. Backstabber by ADR, cheers. Two count, boos. ... ADR missed a senton for the top. As Dave circled for the Batista Bomb, they booed. ADR got out and they cheered. Hit a kick but only two, which rhymes with boo. Batista got the Bomb and got a huge pop....not. He won, but man did he actually lose.</p><p>WWE take heed, they HATE Batista, adjust your plans for Mania.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=83780">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=83780</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2014-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2014</a></p>
