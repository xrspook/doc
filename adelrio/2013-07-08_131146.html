Big E, HOFer Greets Fans, Ziggler</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | July 07, 2013 | Comment</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader D-Bry's YES and Tgeorge and for sending in these results from tonight's WWE live event in Wilkes-Barre, PA:</p><p>The main event was Dolph Ziggler vs Del Rio for the championship in a Last Man Standing match. The match started with your typical showboating from both, Del Rio taking the heat and Ziggler taking the cheers. Boh went back and forth, Ziggler taking shots by the kendo and Del Rio being irished whipped into a table. At the end, a signature heel kick Del Rio put Ziggler through a table for the ten count. After the match, Ziggler hit Del Rio with a Zig Zag to send the fans home happy.</p><p>Biggest Pops: Randy Orton Dolph Ziggler The Usos</p><p>Biggest Heat: PTP Alberto Del Rio AJ Lee and Big E Langston</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0707/563925/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0707/563925/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE House Show Results 7.07.13: Wilkes-Barre, PA</strong></p><p>Posted by Larry Csonka on 07.08.2013</p><p>Mohegan Sun Arena is usually quite welcoming to WWE events, however today's did not seem to get the same hype and advertisement as past shows. Del Rio v. Ziggler was the only match advertised, and much of the upper level seats were not even being sold.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio (C) v. Dolph Ziggler - Last Man Standing Match</p><p>Del Rio has been through Wilkes-Barre before, but never without Ricardo. If anyone is still wondering what happened to Del Rio's pops, they're sitting at home with a 30 day suspension.</p><p>On the other hand, Ziggler received easily the most one-sided reaction of the night, as everyone in the building erupted at his entrance.</p><p>Much of the early going was taunting between the two men, with Ziggler beginning a "USA" chant. The first 10 count would start after Ziggler hit his patented elbows. The match would leave the ring, but return after Del Rio took a few shots of the entrance set and guard rails. Ziger would pull a kendo stick from under the ring, but Del Rio hit a kick, knocking Ziggler off the apron.</p><p>At one point, Del Rio looked to be out of it, but laggard to slide to the outside, landing on his feet any breaking the count at nine.</p><p>Ziggler would then cheat his own death, by staggering back up after being out through a table, and hitting a huge superkick...which would lead to both men being done for another nine count. Ultimately, Del Rio would put Ziggler down for the full ten.</p><p>Winner: Del Rio retains</p><p>After the match, Del Rio would continue to beat Ziggler down, but would be thrown through his own table, and end up on the receiving end of a Zig-Zag.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/289946">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/289946</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
