I thought I heard Lilian say that Sheamus weighed 227 pounds. I am watching live so I can't rewind. If she did, someone f'd up. ... The heels were in control early on, until Jericho kicked Alberto. Now it's every man for himself. ... Booker just said that Alberto looks like he has been hitting the gym. Cole smartly pointed out like all four of the guys in the match look that way. I am changing the saying. It is now, "There is no cure for Booker". ... Early on, they are all getting their stuff in. I expect this will get some time. ... They are doing the bit where it's mostly two guys in the ring while two guys sell on the floor. The two right now are Orton and Sheamus, but Alberto came in and attacked Orton. Sheamus rolled out. Jericho came in an attacked Alberto. Orton rolled out. Now it's party time. ... Orton is bleeding from the bridge of his nose. More unwanted color for WWE. ... Out of nowhere, Jericho puts the Walls on Alberto, which left him open for a Sheamus kick. But, <br>Jericho knew that and ducked it and hit the Codebreaker. ... Cole uses that moment to push some article about whether Jericho should have never come back on WWE.com. Yeah, that is what I want to wonder during a title match I paid big money to see, if one of the guys in it belongs. There is no cure for WWE creative. ... Out of nowhere Orton gets a two count on Jericho. Sheamus hits the Brogue kick on Orton and gets a two when Jericho breaks it up. So, Sheamus hit White Noise on Jericho to retain. I guess WWE.com was right about Y2J. ... Anyway, it was a good match once it got going, the first one on the show. ... Booker just said it had to have gone 35 to 40 minutes. So the English language isn't the only thing he is clueless about. Add telling time to that. ... Orton isn't happy. Looks like we have a face vs. face feud coming for the World Title. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=68618&amp;p=2">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=68618&p=2</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Over The Limit 2012: Randy Orton Vs.

There was literally never a dull moment throughout the entire match, and all four guys did a great job of keeping the action going nonstop from bell to bell. The last three or four minutes of the match were just on onslaught of finisher after finisher after finisher, and I loved it all. Having Sheamus pick up the win was the right decision, because there's no reason to kill his momentum so early into his first run with the belt as a face. Sheamus will be one of WWE's top stars over the course of the next half decade, and he needs a strong title run to establish him as such. There will undoubtedly be those who question the decision to have Jericho eat the pin, and they will claim that this further proves that Jericho's most recent return has been a failure. I tend to believe that the whole point of Jericho's return was to put over the next generation of stars and have great matches, and by those criteria his return has been remarkably successful. Going forward, my guess is that Jericho will fade out of title contention. That will leave Orton and Del Rio as the top contenders for Sheamus' title. Del Rio will probably get a title shot next, but my guess is that we're building toward a title match between Sheamus and Orton at SummerSlam.<br>Match Rating:<br>Slimmer: ****</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/239049/411s-Instant-Access-05.20.12:-WWE-Over-The-Limit-2012.htm">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/239049/411s-Instant-Access-05.20.12:-WWE-Over-The-Limit-2012.htm</a> <br><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/239033"> </a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE over the Limit 2012 Results: Sheamus Retains World Title over Jericho, Orton, Del Rio</strong><br><br>By Big Nasty (Featured Columnist) on May 20, 2012 <br><br>Orton and Sheamus were the focus of this match early as Sheamus got the better of Orton.
