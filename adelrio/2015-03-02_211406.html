Not the Maximo brothers.</p><p>ROH World Television Championship</p><p>Jay Lethal (c) (w/ Truth Martini & J Diesel) vs. Alberto El Patron</p><p>Right out of the gate, Alberto superkicks Diesel, and then knocks Lethal out of the ring. He follows up with a suicide dive and tosses Lethal head first into the guard rail.</p><p>Back in the ring, Alberto hits a flying double axe handle, but gets crotched on the top rope. Lethal capitalizes and starts to choke Alberto. Lethal is clubbing away until Patron pulls a rope-hung armbar out of nowhere.</p><p>Martini and Diesel grab Alberto's foot, allowing him to get superplexed to the mat for a two count. The masked KRD guys are back at ringside as Patron hits a reverse superlex. A lungblower sets Lethal up, but then he locks on Alberto's own armbar! AEP stacks Lethal up and shakes himself loose as Lethal knocks him outside and hits three suicide dives.</p><p>Alberto makes it back in by the 20 count and Lethal gets caught up in the tree of woe. Del Rio comes off the top with double stomps that destroy Lethal. Jay is resilient, however, and comes back with a Lethal Combination for a two count.</p><p>Alberto slugs Lethal, but Martini interferes and gets caught in an amrbar. Lethal comes off the top rope and gets caught in one of his own, but clocks Alberto with the book of Truth. Patron kicks out! Martini blasts him again, and Jay Lethal retains with Lethal Injection. Fantastic match.</p><p>Winner: Jay Lethal via pinfall (Lethal Injection) to retain the ROH World Television Title</p><p>Lethal, along with Brock Lesnar and Pentagon Jr, are the best booked talents on American TV.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0301/589921/ring-of-honor-13th-anniversary-ppv-live-coverage-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0301/589921/ring-of-honor-13th-anniversary-ppv-live-coverage-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WHAT A KILLER PPV! FOUR WAY CHAOS, MURPHY REC CENTER GETS A SHOUT OUT, JOE IS BACK, ALBERTO VS. LETHAL, SIN CITY SUPERKICK PARTY, ACH HAS BEST SHOWING TO DATE VS. AJ, ODB & MARIA TAKE VEGAS, THE DECADE COLLIDE, BIG NIGHT FOR MOOSE, WE HAVE AN AWESOME OPENER! COMPLETE ROH 13th ANNIVERSARY PPV BLOG</strong></p><p>By Mike Johnson on 2015-03-01 20:15:06</p><p>While Stu Carapola is handling play by play tonight, I'll be live blogging thoughts about the Ring of Honor 13th Anniversary PPV. Thanks for logging in with us tonight on PWInsider.com!</p><p>I really liked the opening video with members of the roster getting all dolled up and heading for a night out in Vegas, all dressed like big time players....and followed by Mark Briscoe, in all his redneck glory, taking up the rear. That was a great tongue in cheek silly way to close things out.</p><p>Vegas seemed really excited for the live opening of the show. The look of the show is far improved from the last Final Battle PPV in NYC last year. We'll see whether Dave Scherer shows up on camera!</p><p>We have Spanish announcers for the first time! Cary Silkin is sitting at ringside. During our interview with him Saturday, he wasn't 100% sure he was going to make the show so it's good to see he is there. If anyone deserves to enjoy the anniversary, it's Silkin.</p><p>Jay Lethal vs. Alberto Del Patron is up. Lethal is just awesome as the heel champion. Just a great old school swagger, almost like how Ric Flair carried himself in the 80s. Alberto was a huge star to the audience. No Ricardo. I half-expected him as a surprise. Lots of battling on the floor early. The announcers put over that Alberto was a huge star that wanted to be here in ROH and that he's brought them acclaim and attention. This has been just a great, physical bout with Alberto even taking a bump over the barricade into the crowd off a dive. At one point, Lethal used the rolling armbar and Alberto really had to fight to get out of it. Just great. They worked stiff as well, with Lethal's lip getting busted open. After the dive, Lethal had everything under control but was stopped from hitting a superplex and nailed with a double stomp off the ropes that was good. Truth Martini tried to interfere but was nailed. Alberto put him in the armbar but Lethal came off the ropes. Alberto caught him coming in the armbar but Lethal WALLOPED him with the Book of Truth for a good near fall. Lethal nailed The Lethal Injection after Martini interfered and scored the pin. That was a pretty damn big deal as Lethal just pinned the AAA World champ.</p><p>Really loved the show overall and think it's worth a replay buy. The main event needed more time.</p><p>They announced a PPV return on Friday 6/20 in NYC at Terminal 5. Yes, Friday.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=91989">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=91989</a></p>
