                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2013-09-06 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-09-07 10:05:02+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, smackdown, rob_van_dam, ricardo_rodriguez, whc, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THE SEVENTH TIME IS THE CHARM; IT TAKES A TOWN HALL TO BUILD A UNIVERSE; TOTAL DIVAS FACE SOME BACKLASH; REMATCHES; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-09-06 22:00:13</p><p>On Monday night, Cody Rhodes told Randy Orton the truth. However, the truth wasn’t what Randy or Triple H wanted to hear. Cody Rhodes was given a match with Randy Orton, but Cody had his job on the line. Now that Cody is getting married, he will not be a married WWE Superstar.</p><p>We are in Minneapolis, Minnesota and your announcers are John ‘Welcome to Hennig Country’ Layfield and Michael ‘Why are people calling me Greg Gagne’ Cole.</p><p>We begin with Triple H in the ring along with Brad Maddox and Vickie Guerrero, and all of the wrestlers on the stage . . . well most of them. It is time for the Town Meeting.</p><p>Triple H welcomes everyone and he tells everyone that as of Monday night, Cody Rhodes is no longer a WWE Superstar. Hunter says Cody was fired for ‘just cause’. He was insubordinate and disrespectful to the position of COO of the WWE. The COO of the WWE represents the WWE.</p><p>In essence, as the COO, he is the WWE. Cody Rhodes was disrespectful and insubordinate to each and every one of the people. Hunter says that is something he will not stand for. Hunter says that he gave Cody the right to fight for his job. Cody failed. Hunter says that he did not fire Cody Rhodes. Cody Rhodes fired Cody Rhodes.</p><p>Hunter says that it pains him because he is friends with Cody Rhodes. Hunter says that he is friends with Cody’s dad and brother. It pained him to have to do that, but that is the burden he takes as COO of the WWE. They are hard decisions that have to be made. Sometimes you come off as the bad guy, and he is willing to accept that responsibility.</p><p>Hunter says that is why we are here tonight. He wants to create an open forum because he does not want any misunderstanding of how business is being done. He does not want anyone to fear for their job. Hunter wants to open the floor for everyone and he says that anyone can ask any question without any fear of repercussions.</p><p>Hunter wants to know who wants to go first and no one is anxious to walk to the mic.</p><p>Hunter tells everyone that he works for everyone and he wants to work for everyone. He can only do that if people open up to him and tell him how they feel. He will work harder than any man on the planet for you. He wants this company to grow and he wants to grow.</p><p>Damien Sandow approaches the mic and he says that he fully supports the termination of Cody Rhodes. After all Cody exemplifies everything that is bad for business. For that, he tells Hunter, as their fearless leader, he commends him and he applauds Hunter.</p><p>Hunter says that this is not him looking for people to come out and kiss his butt. He wants everyone to be open and honest.</p><p>Kofi Kingston approaches the mic and he says that Hunter mentioned honesty. Ever since he fired Cody, the locker room is in fear and Kofi says that is not what is best for business. Cody was out there literally fighting for his life, and Hunter took his livelihood away.</p><p>Hunter says that Kofi has made a fair point but from Kofi’s point of view, he wouldn’t understand.</p><p>Heath interrupts and he says that he is a little uncomfortable with the resident giant who is standing there doing nothing while watching everything going on. Heath tells Hunter that he is doing a great job and he appreciates his management style.</p><p>Hunter thanks Heath for emptying his mind.</p><p>Hunter wants people to open up.</p><p>Rob Van Dam takes the mic and he tells Hunter that he is the one who brought him back to WWE. Rob says that he was under the impression that things are better now. Rob says that this vibe is not cool dude.</p><p>Hunter says that he has been waiting since 2000 to have Rob Van Dam call him dude. Hunter tells Rob that he still has the same faith in Rob as when he made the call to bring him back. He says that Rob is a true superstar.</p><p>Ryback makes his way to the mic and he says that he is sick and tired of people calling ‘The Big Guy’ a bully.</p><p>Hunter says that it was not Ryback’s fault that Ziggler was injured when he got to the ring. Ryback did his job and he is getting criticized. He tells Ryback that he can redeem himself. Dolph Ziggler faces Ryback tonight.</p><p>Hunter says that we are opening up. Hunter points out that Daniel Bryan is not on the stage. Daniel not being on the stage is symptomatic of Daniel’s problem. His problem is an ego that is out of control. His ego has gotten so big that he could not bother to be on the same stage as all of the little people. Hunter says that he wanted to look Daniel in the eye and tell him what he will be doing tonight.</p><p>Daniel will get to pick a member of the Shield to face tonight.</p><p>Hunter says that this has been really helpful and cathartic. He is happy for the people who spoke up and he wants to reward them. Kofi is a true leader in the locker room. He will get a non-title match against Curtis Axel. Rob Van Dam. . . dude, will get the opportunity to step into the ring right now . . . next. He will get to face the man he is about to introduce. He is the face of this whole thing.</p><p>Triple H introduces the WWE Champion . . . Randy Orton.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>Before our first match, Alberto Del Rio joins Michael and John at the announce table.</p><p><strong>Match Number One: Randy Orton versus Rob Van Dam (with Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Non Title Match</strong></p><p>Van Dam with a back heel kick and shoulders in the corner.
