Sandow enters the ring making fun of Rodriguez and Oklahomans. Del Rio says Sandow needs to wash his mouth because it smells like "kaka." The match begins and is back and forth before Del Rio wins via submission with the cross armbreaker.</p><p>Jim Ross will interview Zeb Colter and Jack Swagger is later tonight.</p><p>Jim Ross enters in the ring, followed by Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter. JR said that himself and Swagger go back a long way, and talked about recruiting him back in his Sooner days. Swagger called the Sooners a team with no heart. Ross asked Swagger what changed since he left. Zeb Colter says he told Swagger about the truth about America. JR said that he doesn't understand where Zeb is coming from and he directed his question at Swagger. Colter goes on an anti-immigrant rant about how they steal jobs. Colter says himself and Swagger refuse to stand ideally by and watch the country self destruct. Swagger says "we the people." JR mentions WrestleMania, and Colter says that when the dust clears at 'Mania, a real American will walk away with the World Heavyweight Championship -- an English-speaking American. He then said that Alberto Del Rio needs to leave this country. He said the country stinks, and the stink is Del Rio. Swagger is fighting for more than a championship, he's fighting for the heart and soul of our country. JR asked what's happened to Swagger, and says he's brainwashed by Colter. Colter says JR is the one who brainwashed Swagger, and all he did was tell him the truth. JR tells Colter to express his right to remain silent. Colter tells him to be civil and JR says he doesn't care what he thinks. Swagger knocks JR's hat off and says he was wrong about JR, and he's gonna fix the problem. Swagger pokes JR in the chest and backs him into a corner. Swagger says JR isn't a real American, he's a sympathizer. Del Rio comes out to JR's aide.</p><p>Del Rio says Swagger and Colter are the problem and he's the solution. He said Swagger isn't a real American, he's a real jackass. A staredown ensued before Swagger left the ring with Colter.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0226/560717/spoilers-wwe-smackdown-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0226/560717/spoilers-wwe-smackdown-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>FULL SMACKDOWN SPOILERS FROM OKLAHOMA CITY, OK</strong></p><p>By JC Money on 2013-02-26 22:20:56</p><p>Alberto Del Rio beat Damien Sandow. Again, of course.</p><p>JR brought out Swagger and Zeb. JR talked about their Oklahoma roots and JR recruiting him out of college. Swagger said OU had no heart. Ross asked Swagger what happened to him and Zeb stepped up and did an anti immigrant rant. They said Alberto isn't American and needs to leave. It led to Swagger taking a swipe at JR, which led to Alberto coming out. Swagger said JR isn't a real American and left.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=75720">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=75720</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
