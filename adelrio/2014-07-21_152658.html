Before the bout, Barrett vowed to one day strike down the new champion with a Bull Hammer.</p><p>The Battle Royal mayhem began when a slew of Superstars targeted the bout’s largest Superstar — The Great Khali. Using his might, Khali managed to fight off his attackers and send Xavier Woods over the top rope for the first Superstar to be eliminated. Next to go was Zack Ryder, also courtesy of Khali.</p><p>But, the Punjabi Giant himself was next to be eliminated, after getting blasted with a Brogue Kick by Sheamus then hoisted out of the ring by a group of Superstars.</p><p>Sin Cara was next to go, eliminated by Bo Dallas, followed by R-Truth, who was eliminated by Big E and Kofi Kingston. Then, Curtis Axel, Damien Sandow and Matador Diego were sent flying over the top rope.</p><p>As the battle continued and bodies lay strewn about inside and out of the ring, Ryback and Sheamus squared off one-on-one. A Brogue Kick from The Celtic Warrior sent Ryback out of the ring.</p><p>As The Miz and Sheamus tussled, Miz was sent flying out of the ring, but not over the top rope, and thus staying a legal competitor.</p><p>Next, Bo Dallas eliminated Titus O’Neil. Using awesome athleticism, Kofi Kingston managed to stay alive during a scrap with Cesaro.</p><p>Then in a stunner, Dolph Ziggler eliminated Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>As the war raged, Big E knocked Miz from the ring again, but once again through the ropes.</p><p>Next, Cesaro eliminated Big E, then went for Kingston. But the high-flier managed to leap onto Big E’s shoulders and continue battling Cesaro, who inadvertently helped Kofi stay in contention when he flipped him into the ring. As they continued to battle, Cesaro finally got the better off Kingston, sending him to the arena floor.</p><p>Next, Slater shockingly eliminated Cesaro, followed by Sheamus then eliminating Slater with a Brogue Kick.</p><p>Sheamus punished Dallas with 10 forearms to the chest, then Ziggler finished off Dallas, sending him flying from the ring.</p><p>As Sheamus and Ziggler squared off, Miz lurked in wait on the arena floor, still in contention. Pushing their bodies to the limit, both Superstars fought for the title. Ultimately, Ziggler eliminated Sheamus and seemingly claimed another championship. Quickly seizing the opportunity to strike, Miz jumped back in the ring and eliminated Ziggler to become a three-time Intercontinental Champion.</p><p>Although scheduled to be in the bout, RVD did not compete due to injury.
