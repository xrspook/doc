                            <h1>WWE Raw 2013-02-11 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-02-12 12:19:55+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, raw, damien_sandow, big_show, ricardo_rodriguez, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>COMPLETE WWE RAW REPORT: ROCK HAS A BEDTIME STORY, BUT WHO GETS PUT TO SLEEP?; REMATCH OF THE MAIN EVENT OF THE FIRST EPISODE OF NXT; THE SMACKDOWN ELIMINATION CHAMBER IS SET; SWAGGER SHOWS THAT HE HAS THE RIGHT STUFF; NEW INDUCTEES TO THE HALL OF PAIN</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-11 20:11:13</p><p>We are less than a week from the Elimination Chamber and it is time for the final push to the pay per view. Will the Shield regain their position of power when it comes to John Cena, Sheamus, and Ryback or will they give up the advantage that they have held since their debut? Will we see Big Show complain about how he is being treated by Booker T and the World Champion? What will happen with the current tag team champions as it appears that they are on different pages? Will 3MB debut their first country single?</p><p>Previously . . . on Raw, the Shield finally got a taste of their own medicine from their opponents at the Elimination Chamber. Oh yeah, The Rock is defending the WWE Title against the man who claims that he never lost it.</p><p>This week, Raw is in Nashville, Tennessee and your announcers are Jerry ‘Home of the Predators’ Lawler and Michael ‘Our Tame Wrestling Announcer’ Cole.</p><p>We are back and Big Show makes his way to the ring. Matt Striker is in the ring to interview Show. Matt asks his first question but before he can finish, Show knocks out Striker.</p><p>Show picks up the mic and he wants to say something but he cannot summon the proper words to express his feelings.</p><p>Show drops the mic and he leaves the ring. Matt Striker has not moved the entire time.</p><p>Michael and Jerry wonder whether Alberto Del Rio’s actions are best for his future as World Champion.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez walk in the back. Ricardo has his bucket and Alberto has his scarf.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Damien Sandow demands that the music be silenced. The WWE finds itself in the Mecca of country music, Nashville and that is not a good thing. This city prides itself in glorifying itself with songs about dead dogs, broken down pick up trucks, and ignoramuses getting their hearts broken. They listen to this music instead of Mozart and Beethoven. He is doing this not to agitate them, but to save them from the doldrums of their self imposed inadequacies.</p><p>You’re Welcome.</p><p><strong>Match Number Seven: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Damien Sandow in a Non Title Match</strong></p><p>Sandow with a kick and knees to Del Rio. Sandow with a side Russian leg sweep followed by the Elbow of Disdain. Sandow misses a charge into the corner and Del Rio with two clotheslines and then he avoids a clothesline from Sandow and hits a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a super kick for a near fall.</p><p>Del Rio floats over into the cross arm breaker and Sandow taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Alberto says that Big Show gave us the best promo of his life earlier tonight. For the first time in his life, he agrees with Big Show. The time for talking is over. The time for parking lots, hotel rooms, and tour buses is over. After Sunday, Show can go anywhere in his tour bus because Alberto says that there is only one place he is going.</p><p>Alberto points to the Wrestlemania sign and then he says that he is going to Wrestlemania.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=75352&p=2">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=75352&p=2</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
