He says that he is here for one reason. He wants to address one of the most controversial things he has seen in the WWE. He brings out Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter.</p><p>Jim reminds Jack that they go back a long way and even if they aren’t on the same page, he respects Jack’s athletic ability. Jim mentions that he recruited Jack while he was still at the University of Oklahoma.</p><p>Jack interrupts and asks Jim if he means that place with no heart thirty miles south of where they are. He says that he believes that Jim is a real American and that is why they granted this interview.</p><p>Zeb says that after Monday with the Miz they wanted to make sure that they could deal with someone who would treat them fairly.</p><p>Jim says that he has some questions for Jack and Zeb.

Jim wants to know what happened.</p><p>Zeb says that he told Jack what the real problem was in this country and the reality and truth of what is happening every day.</p><p>Jim says that he was addressing Jack and he does not understand where Zeb is coming from.</p><p>Zeb says that Jim refuses to see. WWE is a microcosm of what is happening in this country. How is it possible that Jack could go on a losing streak to allow a foreigner to sneak in and take a position that belongs to an American.</p><p>Every day, thousands of undocumented workers are crossing our borders and they are taking jobs from real Americans. They will not stand idly by while this country self destructs. Jack adds a ‘We the People’.</p><p>Jim points out that Jack can be the World Champion if he can beat Alberto.</p><p>Zeb says that the title will be around the waist of a natural born American who can recite the Pledge of Allegiance, speaks English, and has worked for everything that he has gotten in this country. Alberto is not one of us and he does not share our values. He needs to leave this country.</p><p>Zeb asks Jim Ross what he does with a fruit basket that rots in his kitchen. Does he keep it or dump it. Zeb says that the stink that we are smelling is Alberto Del Rio. Zeb says that Jack is fighting for more than a championship, he is fighting for the heart and soul of this country.</p><p>Jim wants to know what happened to Jack and he says that Zeb has brainwashed him.</p><p>Zeb says that is a pretty big word. Since Jim knew Jack during his formative years, it was Jim who brainwashed him.</p><p>Jim suggests that Zeb exercise his right to remain silent.</p><p>Zeb suggests that Jim keep a civil tongue in his head lest something happen that he will regret later on.</p><p>Jim says that he doesn’t know or care what Zeb is saying.</p><p>Jack knocks JR’s hat off his head and he says that Zeb is a real American. Jack says that Jim is either a part of the problem or the solution. They are going to fix the problem. He says that JR is not a real American, he is a sympathizer.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio comes to the ring to help Jim Ross. Del Rio gives Jim Ross his hat.</p><p>Alberto tells them that they have it wrong. Jack and Zeb are the problem and he is the solution. He tells Jack that he is not a real American . . . Jack is a real Jack . . . ass.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75782/wwe-smackdown-report-a-real-american-a-us-title-match-a-mexican-comes-to-the-aid-of-good-ole-jr-a-promo-goes-to-caca-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75782/wwe-smackdown-report-a-real-american-a-us-title-match-a-mexican-comes-to-the-aid-of-good-ole-jr-a-promo-goes-to-caca-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
