In recent months, the reigning titleholder has captured the hearts of the WWE Universe. After toppling Big Show to claim the World Heavyweight Title in the first of two explosive Last Man Standing Matches — his third World Championship overall — the Mexican champion has lifted the fans on his shoulders.</p><p>While Del Rio has earned the endearment of the people, however, that in no way means that he has become all flash and no substance. Instead, the skilled competitor is more dangerous than ever, armed with his dreaded Cross Armbreaker and skull-rattling kicks capable of putting anyone out at a moment’s notice. And with his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez in tow, overcoming the World Heavyweight Champion on The Grandest Stage of Them All will be no easy task.</p><p>Find out who will emerge with the World Heavyweight Title around their waist in a battle of a charismatic champion of the people and a supposed “Real American.” Don’t miss your chance to witness the splendor as entertainment’s greatest event comes home. Order WrestleMania 29, Sunday, April 7 at 7:00 p.m./4:00 p.m. PT — only on pay-per-view!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/29/alberto-del-rio-jack-swagger-26092473">http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/29/alberto-del-rio-jack-swagger-26092473</a></p>
