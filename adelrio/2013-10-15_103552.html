RYBACK; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-10-14 20:05:30</p><p>We are in St. Louis, Missouri and your announcers are Michael ‘What will happen to Randy Orton in his home town’ Cole, John ‘I want to see El Torito leap from the Gateway Arch’ Layfield, and Jerry ‘What gets thrown in the Mississippi River tonight’ Lawler.</p><p>We are back and it is time for Triple H to make his way to the ring. He is accompanied by one of the principal owners of WWE, Stephanie McMahon.</p><p>Stephanie says that last week on Raw, she learned a very valuable lesson. She is not going to let her kindness be seen as weakened.</p><p>Stephanie says that they have bailed out the Big Show more times than they can remember.

Hunter says that his breaking point took place last week when he was unconscious in the ring while people were chanting ‘Yes’. The crowd chants ‘Yes’.</p><p>Hunter says this is the way it is. After all they have done, they are just the villains. Hunter asks if everyone wants him to be the bad guy . . . fine. He will give you something like you have never seen before. Big Show will grovel at his feet to avoid incarceration or financial ruin. Anyone who defies their authority will beg to keep their jobs.</p><p>Anyone who thought the word yes better pray right now.</p><p>Daniel Bryan’s music plays and he makes his way to the stage and he gets everyone to start chanting yes, if they weren’t already chanting it.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio attacks Daniel Bryan from behind and they make their way down the ramp.
