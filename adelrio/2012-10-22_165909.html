NEXUS, TWO CELL MATCHES AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Mike Johnson on 2010-10-03 20:20:00</p><p>Alberto Del Rio made his way to the ring with Rodrigo Rodriguez doing his big introduction in Spanish. Del Rio took the mic and bragged that tonight was his PPV debut and he wanted to make it special. He said that a man like him can take days counting his fortune but instead he's in Dallas, trying to help the fans. He told the fans not to cheer him, but they can thank him. He mocked Rey Mysterio and Christian, then asked who was going to be the next man to face him. He said that since this was Texas, he thought things were bigger but said he could buy each and every one of you. He continued ripping on the fans until Edge came out.</p><p>Edge said he was not out here to defend anyone but he was in a battle against stupidity. He ripped on the little dog on Smackdown dressed like Rey Mysterio and Del Rio's scarf. Del Rio told him to think very carefully about what he said. Edge began insulting Del Rio in broken Spanish. Edge ripped on Del Rio's announcer, calling him stupid and ripped his jacket. Del Rio and Edge looked like they were about to go down when Jack Swagger came out and said what's stupid is a Mexican and a Canadian fighting on the PPV when Swagger isn't wrestling. Swagger complained about Edge beating up his mascot. Edge said he would pay the mascot's medical bills and then he'd pay Swagger's as well. Del Rio attacked Edge from behind and Swagger joined in.</p><p>The General Manager's email advisory came through. Michael Cole announced that Edge would have to issue a public apology tomorrow and right now, it will be Edge vs. Jack Swagger.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=51455&p=2">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=51455&p=2</a></p>
