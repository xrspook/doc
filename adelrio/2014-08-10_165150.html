The person joked something along the lines of how that's Del Rio's job. Del Rio found out about the comments and confronted the person. The person did not offer an apology and smiled at Del Rio, which reportedly led to the slap from Del Rio.</p><p>UPDATE x3: According to Pwinsider.com (via wrestlezone.com) here is another update on the Alberto Del Rio situation. The latest word is that Del Rio slapped an employee in reaction to a racist comment made towards him. WWE does not plan to make any further comment on the situation.</p><p>UPDATE x2: F4wonline.com reports that there are different stories going around regarding the reason behind Alberto Del Rio's WWE release, one of which is that Del Rio slapped a WWE.com reporter at this week's television tapings.</p><p>At this time, the belief is that he will have the standard 90-day non-compete clause. This would apply to TNA and AAA, who are both said to have interest in him. AAA is launching their US expansion this year, with a show on the El Rey Network.</p><p>UPDATE: Take this for the rumor it is right now (and frankly, consider the source). But Rob Feinstein of RF Video posted to Facebook, saying that Del Rio got into an altercation with an employee that does social media for WWE.</p><p>According to Feinstein, "words were exchanged and a slap which is all just allegations at this point." He did say that Del Rio was "100% let go" after the incident. Feinstein didn't list any sources or even say he HAD a source, so take the information with a grain of salt.</p><p>As we've previously reported, Del Rio's contract was set to end this year and he had expressed interest in going back to Mexico.</p><p>ORIGINAL: WWE announced today that Alberto Del Rio has been released. The short statement on WWE.com reads:</p><p>WWE announced the release of Alberto Del Rio due to unprofessional conduct and an altercation with an employee.</p><p>Obviously, more on this as it becomes available. Del Rio--real name Alberto Rodríguez--has been with WWE since June of 2010. He made his debut on the main roster on June 25th of that year, winning the WWE Title twice and the World Heavyweight Title twice.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/331377">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/331377</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Backstage Talk On Alberto Del Rio's WWE Departure, Who Has Interest In Him</strong></p><p>By Marc Middleton | August 07, 2014</p><p>Source: F4WOnline F4Wonline.com backs up the earlier report that the story going around is Alberto Del Rio slapped a WWE.com reporter at this week's TV tapings.

It's also interesting that they did not wish him the best in his future endeavors.</p><p>For what it's worth, Rob Feinstein of RF Video wrote on his Facebook that Del Rio was involved in a backstage incident at the recent WWE TV tapings. RF claimed that Del Rio had words with an employee who works for WWE's social media department and allegedly slapped him. This should be taken as strictly rumor for now.</p><p>We've noted how Del Rio has expressed interest in leaving WWE and returning to Mexico once his deal expired this year.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0807/579781/more-on-wwe-alberto-del-rio-release-announcement/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0807/579781/more-on-wwe-alberto-del-rio-release-announcement/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio Rips Ricardo Rodriguez, Financial Site Says Network Risking WWE's Future, More</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | August 03, 2014</p><p>Alberto Del Rio replaced Ricardo Rodriguez as the interviewer for the backstage interviews that are inserted to the Raw and Smackdown broadcasts in Mexico.

Usually when WWE announces talent departures they use their real name but Del Rio's real name was not used in today's announcement. They also didn't wish him well in his future endeavors, as is customary.</p><p>If Del Rio really is gone from the company, his last match would have been a loss to Jack Swagger on this week's Main Event. He did not work the SmackDown taping and did not work today's live event in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>It was recently reported that Del Rio's contract was expiring soon.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0807/579780/notes-on-alberto-del-rio-wwe-departure/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wrestlinginc_news+%28WrestlingInc.com+Pro+Wrestling+News%29">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0807/579780/notes-on-alberto-del-rio-wwe-departure/?utm<em>source=feedburner&utm</em>medium=feed&utm<em>campaign=Feed%3A+wrestlinginc</em>news+%28WrestlingInc.com+Pro+Wrestling+News%29</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Report On Identity Of The WWE Employee Alberto Del Rio Had Backstage Altercation With 24</strong></p><p>By Daniel Pena | August 09, 2014</p><p>Source: F4WOnline</p><p>The name of Alberto Del Rio remains a hot topic after the four-time world champion was released from his WWE contract on Thursday.</p><p>Shortly after WWE announced that Del Rio was let go "due to unprofessional conduct and an altercation with an employee," Ring of Honor founder and RF Video owner Rob Feinstein claimed that Del Rio slapped a member of WWE's social media team at a television taping this week. This claim was backed up by both F4WOnline.com and PWInsider.com. To add a new layer to the story, the identity of the person Del Rio had the backstage altercation with has apparently been revealed.</p><p>As members of the F4WOnline.com message board were discussing Del Rio's termination and speculating which WWE employee was on the receiving end of his slap, Wrestling Observer editor Dave Meltzer remarked "Cody Barbierri."</p><p>On LinkedIn and Twitter, Barbierri identifies himself as WWE's manager of social media live events. Though not identified by name, F4WOnline.com's updated story on Del Rio's termination says the altercation involved the social media manager of WWE.</p><p>According to the new report, WWE's social media manager was supposedly asked to wipe his plate clean following a meal in catering. He allegedly joked that it was Del Rio's job to clean the plate, which could be perceived as racist by Hispanic people. Del Rio was informed of the comment, and confronted him. The individual did not apologize for his remark and then smiled at him. Fuming, Del Rio slapped him.</p><p>Addressing the matter Friday evening, WWE released a statement via Twitter asking fans to direct their anger toward Del Rio since he did not conduct himself in a professional matter: "@VivaDelRio is responsible for his own actions. If you're angry at anyone, be angry at Alberto. There's no excuse for a pro athlete not to conduct themselves in a professional manner."</p><p>Paul "Triple H" Levesque, WWE's Executive Vice President, Talent, Live Events and Creative, re-Tweeted the comment in its entirety.</p><p>According to F4WOnline.com, Del Rio is believed to be subject to a 90-day no-compete clause, which would prevent him from immediately joining TNA and AAA. Both organizations are reportedly interested in his services.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0809/579819/report-on-identity-of-the-wwe-employee-alberto-del-rio-was-fired/">http://wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0809/579819/report-on-identity-of-the-wwe-employee-alberto-del-rio-was-fired/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Backstage Update On Alberto Del Rio's WWE Departure, Mainstream Media Coverage</strong></p><p>By Marc Middleton | August 09, 2014</p><p>Backstage Update On Alberto Del Rio's WWE Departure, Mainstream Media Coverage</p><p>Source: F4WOnline</p><p>Triple H re-tweeting WWE's message to angry Alberto Del Rio fans had many thinking that the whole release and backstage incident with a WWE.com employee was part of a storyline.

Obviously this won't do much to set to ease speculation over what happened and whether it's a work or not.</p><p>ORIGINAL: This one is a little out of character for WWE and really solidifies the idea that Alberto Del Rio really pissed someone off in doing whatever he did that caused his release. (Or, if you're conspiracy-minded, that he isn't actually fired.) WWE's official Twitter account posted the following messages in reference to Del Rio being let go yesterday:</p><p>WWE: (1/2) @VivaDelRio is responsible for his own actions. If you’re angry at anyone, be angry at Alberto. 4:43 AM - 9 Aug 2014</p><p>https://twitter.com/WWE/statuses/497845523437875202</p><p>WWE: (2/2) There’s no excuse for a pro athlete not to conduct themselves in a professional manner. 4:43 AM - 9 Aug 2014</p><p>https://twitter.com/WWE/statuses/497845542731653120</p><p>WWE has never been one to address moves in this manner, but the very terse wording of the initial release announcement seemed out of place as well. That they referenced his Twitter account is a little odd too; it could be seen as either a way to directly make him aware of what they were saying (as you are notified of any direct mentions to your Twitter handle) or that they're still promoting him for some reason.</p><p>The latter may suggest to some that Del Rio is actually still employed and that this is some kind of angle where they're working the fans, except that WWE has always been very clear when releases or punishments such as Wellness violations are announced on WWE that they are not storyline. If this is a change in policy, it would seem an odd one and it would seem odd that they would either use his alleged assault against a WWE employee (or make up such an assault, if that's the case) as a kickstart to a storyline. It is worth noting that Del Rio has not, as of the time of this writing, changed his Twitter name from "Alberto Del Rio" which is a WWE-specific name. He has been moved to the alumni section of WWE.com.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/331500">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/331500</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>More Backstage News On Alberto Del Rio's WWE Departure, What He's Saying Happened</strong></p><p>By Marc Middleton | August 08, 2014</p><p>Source: PWInsider Elite</p><p>As noted, WWE released Alberto Del Rio on Thursday for what they called an incident with an employee.</p><p>A third source has now reported to PWInsider that Del Rio allegedly slapped a WWE.com worker at this week's TV tapings.

Adicionalmente en 2013 Del Rio se convirtió en dos veces campeón de peso completo. Sin embargo, el mexicano permaneció alejado de las principales rivalidades durante los últimos meses, luchando contra diversos rivales en Raw, Smackdown y Main Event.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://superluchas.net/2014/08/07/alberto-del-rio-despedido-de-wwe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=alberto-del-rio-despedido-de-wwe">http://superluchas.net/2014/08/07/alberto-del-rio-despedido-de-wwe/?utm<em>source=rss&utm</em>medium=rss&utm_campaign=alberto-del-rio-despedido-de-wwe</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Jim Ross Talks Del Rio’s Release, Too Many Titles in Wrestling, More</strong></p><p>Posted by Larry Csonka on 08.11.2014</p><p>On Alberto Del Rio's WWE release: "I do not know the details of what happened with ADR and the WWE employee.

The story making the rounds is that Del Rio allegedly slapped a WWE.com staffer at a WWE TV taping last week.</p><p>In speaking to a source close to Del Rio Thursday evening, I was told that his side of the story is that he was responding to something said that he felt was racist in nature.</p><p>We've heard from multiple sources over the last several years that Del Rio hadn't been happy with his run in the company and that there was talk of him looking to retire when his contract had expired. He had recently relocated to Texas, which some in the company believed was so he could be closer to Mexico once his WWE run was over.</p><p>The release was discussed a lot backstage at the third TNA TV Taping in NYC once word got out. The impression I have is that if and when ADR is available they would be very open to speaking to him.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=87480&p=1&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+pwinsider+%28PWInsider+Latest+Articles%29">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=87480&p=1&utm<em>source=feedburner&utm</em>medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+pwinsider+%28PWInsider+Latest+Articles%29</a></p>
