He proclaimed that the most must see champion of all time has returned to Summerslam. He said that he wanted to thank each and every one of the fans for their insistence that he compete tonight and for all their unwavering support. He told them to sit back and steal the show as only he....</p><p>R Truth's music began and Truth came out. He said that he didn't know why The Miz would want to thank anyone in Los Angeles. He said that he hates spiders and they start with the letter "S" as does Summerslam. He tied Cee Lo Green into his conspiracy. He started in on the crowd, but Alberto Del Rio's music began. He came to the ring, where he got a nice positive reaction.</p><p>The babyfaces all made singular entrances as well.</p><p>Kingston and Miz started out. Miz ate a monkeyflip. Morrison tagged in and they doubled oin Miz. Miz was able to tag out to Truth. Morrison tackled him and slammed him into the turnbuckles. Morrison nailed a springboard kick to Truth's head. Truth came back with a big right and several kicks to the head. He charged Morrison in the corner but was kicked off.</p><p>Before Morrison could build any momentum, Miz shoved Morrison off the apron to the floor. Truth followed him down and slammed his face into the apron. Truth brought him back into the ring and locked in a rear chinlock after a snapmare. Miz tagged in and drilled Morrison with a kick to the chest for a two count. Miz cinched in a side chinlock, working over Morrison.</p><p>Morrison made his way to his feet. Miz went to pull him back down but Morrison kicked Miz as he went down and made the tag to Kofi. Kingston leapt in with a dropkick and followed up with several others. Miz manuevered him into the corner but was kicked off. Kingston hit a double jump bodypress for a two count. He fired up and nailed the Boom Boom Drop. Kingston set up for Trouble in Paradise but Miz ducked and went for the Skull Crushing Finale. Kingston reversed that into the SOS but Del Rio broke it up.</p><p>It broke down with the others battling. Miz nailed a cutter into a jawbreaker for a two count. That move will be stolen by everyone in a month. Truth tagged in and beat down Kingston. Truth lifted Kingston for a suplex and dropped him down. Del Rio tagged in. Big reaction for that.</p><p>Alberto nailed a textbook belly to back suplex for a two count and began mocking Kingston's mannerisms. Kingston kicked him away and almost made the tag but Miz cut him off and nailed a suplex. Kingston fired back but was cut off with a clothesline. Miz locked in another rear chinlock. Kingston fought back to his feet. He finally made the hot tag to Rey.</p><p>Rey came in with some hot offense on Truth and Miz. Truth went for a sunset flip but Rey rolled through and nailed a roundhouse kick to the head for a two count. Rey set him up for the 619. Miz got involved and was set up as well. Rey went for it but Del Rio tripped him up. Morrison dove on Rio. Rey nailed the 619 on Truth as Miz escaped. Miz was dispatched. Rey hit a top rope splash on Truth and scored the win.</p><p>Your winners, Kofi Kingston & John Morrison & Rey Mysterio</p><p>Good back and forth opener. I'd love to see WWE hold more six man tags on PPVs as it allows for all sorts of different combinations and fresh interactions. Rey was held out for the most part to protect his ailing knee but</p><p>Cena tried to explain to HHH but Hunter said he didn't see it. Punk sat in the ringside table smiling and began walking around ringside celebrating. Cena left while HHH wguirias standing in the ring. Punk returned to the ring. HHH offered his hand. Punk wouldn't take it. HHH raised his hand. HHH exited the ring.</p><p>Punk celebrated on the ropes when Kevin Nash, YES KEVIN NASH, hit the ring and clotheslined Punk, then powerbombed him before heading through the crowd. HHH returned to ringside looking stunned.</p><p>Out came Alberto Del Rio with the Money in the Bank contract. He cashes in and drills Punk the leaping enziguiri, pinning Punk.</p><p>Your winner and new WWE champion, Alberto Del Rio!</p><p>HHH argued with the referee who counted the fall but was told it was legal.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=60770">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=60770</a></p>
