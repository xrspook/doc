While the action was chaotic from start to finish, it paled in comparison to the incredible pay-per-view announcement that would come moments later.<br><br>World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus opened SmackDown, justifying his attack on his new No. 1 contender Alberto Del Rio one week ago and declaring that at No Way Out, he would not kiss the backside of his extravagant challenger — like so many do — but would instead kick it. (MATCH PREVIEW) After making it clear that money will not be able to buy Del Rio the World Title, The Celtic Warrior was interrupted by John Laurinaitis' legal counsel, David Otunga, who once again ordered an apology from the Irish Superstar for shoving the General Manager of both Raw and SmackDown on the May 21 edition of Raw.<br><br>As The Great White refused to comply with that directive, Del Rio joined the party — giving his opinion that Sheamus will, in fact, be very sorry when The Mexican Aristocrat captures his championship gold at No Way Out. Otunga, in turn, revealed that Big Johnny authorized him to let the champion’s pay-per-view adversary to choose who Sheamus would take on later on SmackDown.<br><br>In light of that news, The Celtic Warrior opted to apologize after all, not for pushing “Mr. Excitement” but for the earth-shattering Brogue Kick he would lay on Otunga seconds later. Putting the exclamation of his action, Sheamus warned a retreating Del Rio to never trust a “hooligan.”</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-01/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-01/results</a></p><blockquote><p>At the beginning of SmackDown, Alberto Del Rio was given the right to choose World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus' opponent for the night — just 16 days before he will challenge The Great White for the title at No Way Out. Later, while The Mexican Aristocrat was attempting to determine his selection, Dolph Ziggler volunteered — determined to establish his own elite status in the squared circle. Seeing the passion in The Showoff’s eyes, the No. 1 contender was more than happy to grant his wish.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-01/results/page-5">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-01/results/page-5</a><br></p>
