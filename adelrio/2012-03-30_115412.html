CM Punk to retain the WWE title.  This was announced as the first half of the main event, with the winner moving on to defend against John Cena at the end of the night.  Punk was the total babyface here, and Ricardo Rodriguez was hilarious in his role as general irritant.  The early part of the match saw Punk throwing leg kicks and Del Rio bailing for a leg massage from Ricardo after each one, which was a fun little segment.  Obviously they had it dialed WAY down for this, as the usual “chase the manager” sequence led to Del Rio getting a cheapshot and working Punk over until the inevitable comeback.  Rodriguez did a bunch of heel manager stuff, leading to the finish where Punk went to the top and got tripped up for the Del Rio pin.  ADR is my hero because he WEARS THE BELT rather than slinging it over his shoulder like a prop.  **1/2Alberto Del Rio is a great man.</p><p>Main event:  John Cena d. Alberto Del Rio by DQ.  Let me tell you, there was no conflicted crowd here.  This was a 100% pro-Cena crowd, and they were rabid for everything he did.  Pretty solid match, with COOHHH banning Rodriguez from ringside (with a note sent via the referee), leaving ADR to work on Cena’s arm all by himself.  Nice spot saw Del Rio’s armbar attempt turned into a powerbomb by Cena,and of course we got all the greatest hits from Cena.  The ref gets bumped to set up the STF, and of course Ricardo runs back in for the DQ and heel beatdown before CM Punk returns to make the save.  The Megapowers it was not, but everyone went home happy.  **</p>
