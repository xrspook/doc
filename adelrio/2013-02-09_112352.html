Plus, not even a suspension could keep World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio from bringing some color into Big Show’s life.</p><p>An emotionally driven Big Show opened SmackDown, claiming the recent treatment he had endured was completely unacceptable — a byproduct of being, in his opinion, unpopular. He said that when a Superstar was popular — like Alberto Del Rio — he could do whatever they wanted to.</p><p>The giant insisted he simply couldn’t understand the WWE Universe. Either he was getting called a “bully” for fighting Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez or a “coward” for hanging back in his hotel room to conduct his business. In contrast, he saw World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio being cheered for attacking him in his hotel room on Raw.</p><p>Regardless, The World’s Largest Athlete insisted the World Title would once again be his at WWE Elimination Chamber.</p><p>Show went on to say SmackDown General Manager Booker T was largely to blame for the “double standard” he was experiencing, claiming the head of the blue brand was jealous of him. Scoffing at Del Rio’s suspension, Big Show suggested that Booker may have helped his attacker get his room information in the first place.</p><p>Denying the claims of the World Title No. 1 contender, Booker advised the enormous Superstar to worry instead about his huge SmackDown contest: Big Show vs. Kane!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-02-08/results-26089869">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-02-08/results-26089869</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Big Show def. Kane. Del Rio made some changes to Big Show’s bus and to the giant</strong></p><p></p><p>Prior to his match against Kane, The World’s Largest Athlete was seen admonishing his bus driver for various things. As he walked away, it was revealed that suspended World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio had been watching the whole thing.</p><p>With Booker T and Teddy Long looking on, The World’s Largest Athlete entered the ring, looking to play spoiler as The Big Red Monster attempted to impress his way in the World Heavyweight Championship No. 1 Contender’s Elimination Chamber Match at the upcoming pay-per-view.</p><p>Ultimately, the giant would triumph in the absolute battle of the titans that followed with the KO Punch. Big Show’s mood quickly shot back into pure exasperation, though, when Alberto Del Rio appeared on the TitanTron. The World Heavyweight Champion revealed that he had made friends with his No. 1 contender’s disgruntled bus driver, inviting Big Show to come see the exciting changes he had made to his bus.</p><p>When the enraged giant stomped his way back to the parking area, he discovered that all of the back tires on his bus were gone! Then, as he stood there trying to get a grasp on the situation, Del Rio dropped a bucket of orange paint all over The World’s Largest Athlete and his super-sized ride from above — leaving the giant fuming as he and Rodriguez drove off, grinning ear to ear.<br></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-02-08/results-26089869/page-5">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-02-08/results-26089869/page-5</a></p>
