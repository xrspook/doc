Meanwhile, SmackDown General Manager Booker T and Mick Foley placed the members of Sunday’s Traditional Elimination Tag Team Match into a series of bouts that quickly descended into a struggle for pay-per-view momentum.</p><p><strong>“Miz TV” with special guest Mick Foley</strong></p><p>In addition to basking in the glory of bringing his controversial talk show, “Miz TV,” to his hometown Cleveland, The Miz also celebrated the fact that Monday’s RAWactive poll chose him to fill the vacant spot on Team Foley in the Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match Sunday. After pledging he would not follow any team captain, however, the outspoken Superstar welcomed Mick Foley in the ring — the iconic Superstar fitting that very job description.</p><p>After The Hardcore Legend took the opportunity to plug his new book, “A Most Mizerable Christmas,” he posed the question: Which Miz was going to show up to Survivor Series? Would it be The Miz who accomplished so many milestones in his WWE career or would it be the somewhat laid-back, more talk/less action Miz?</p><p>When the “Miz TV” host pointed out that Mick should worry about the dysfunction of the other members of the Survivor Series group rather than him, Foley welcomed all of Team Foley into the ring.</p><p>When he “opened the lines of communication,” Team Hell No used the opportunity to further argue with each other. Then, when things almost turned volatile between archrivals Kofi Kingston and Miz, Foley called on Randy Orton to be the “voice of reason.” But the nine-time World Champion said that despite their volatile history, he liked Foley more than anyone of the team — a group he didn’t “like or trust at all.”</p><p></p><p>They were soon interrupted by the majority of Team Ziggler — minus Cody Rhodes, who sustained an injury on Wednesday’s WWE Main Event. While Dolph Ziggler proclaimed Foley’s team the “definition of dysfunction,” a verbal exchange with Alberto Del Rio showed some cracks in their armor as well.</p><p>As the two Survivor Series teams bickered back and forth, Foley revealed three main event matches he suggested and got approved by SmackDown General Manager Booker T: Kingston vs. Damien Sandow, Orton & The Miz vs. Del Rio & Ziggler and Kane vs. Wade Barrett.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-16/results-26068102">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-16/results-26068102</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown Results: Big Show overcame Khali; Sheamus engaged the giant in parking lot onslaught</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>November 16, 2012</p><p><strong>Randy Orton & The Miz def. Alberto Del Rio & Dolph Ziggler</strong></p><p></p><p>In the second match of the night between Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match participants, Randy Orton reluctantly joined forces with The Miz against The Mexican Aristocrat & Mr. Money in the Bank.</p><p>In the final moments, just when WWE’s Apex Predator looked poised to execute the RKO on Del Rio, his “Awesome” partner suddenly tagged himself into the action, hitting the Skull-Crushing Finale on a staggered Mexican Aristocrat to steal the three-count.</p><p>Furious over being cheated out of a win over his adversary Del Rio and taking all he could of Miz in the post-match celebration, the irate Viper lashed out, hitting an RKO on his own Survivor Series teammate.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-16/results-26068102/page-4">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-16/results-26068102/page-4</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown Results: Big Show overcame Khali; Sheamus engaged the giant in parking lot onslaught</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>November 16, 2012</p><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion Kane def. Wade Barrett by Disqualification</strong></p><p></p><p>After almost every member of Team Ziggler charged to the ring and ambushed Kane during his brutal showdown against Wade Barrett, the referee had no choice but to call for the bell.</p><p>Mick Foley soon sent his Superstars down the ramp to even the odds, creating an all-out brawl between members of the two Survivor Series Teams — minus a conspicuously absent Miz and the injured Cody Rhodes.</p><p>Team Foley swiftly cleared the ring of their pay-per-view adversaries. But when both Sandow and Ziggler re-engaged for more, The Viper opted to treat each of them to swift punishment, in the form of dual RKOs.</p><p>As the dust cleared, The Miz finally emerged, staring down his teammates this Sunday. And the question remains, how will The Awesome One fit into the mix?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-16/results-26068102/page-6">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-16/results-26068102/page-6</a></p>
