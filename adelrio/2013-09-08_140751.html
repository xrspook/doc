Before I say how it went, I'd like to keep in mind what was advertised when we bought the tickets. There is the standard warning about the card being subject to change, but advertised were Cody Rhodes ("fired"), Christian (injured), Sheamus (injured), The Shield (other WWE show), and Daniel Bryan (other WWE show).</p><p>We had ringside seats and the kids were pumped for the show.</p><p>(1) Dolph Ziggler won a battle royal to get a World Title shot. Participants included "2MB" (Jinder and Heath Slater), Ryback, Tensai, Brodus Clay, Ziggler, Damien Sandow, Fandango, Big E. Langston, Prime Time Players, and Xavier Woods.</p><p>The start was funny - everyone in the ring teamed up to eliminate Fandango. Good stuff. Sitting ringside, I could see the wrestlers talking to each other and see Ziggler smiling and laughing at points. In the end, 2MB were the last ones left. Then, of course, Ziggler came out of nowhere because he was never eliminated and took care of 2MB. But then, Sandow popped up because he was never eliminated, either. Ziggler eventually came out on top.</p><p>(8) Dolph Ziggler beat World Hvt. champion Alberto Del Rio via DQ; Del Rio retained the World Title. The main event started slow, but it was good; the wrestlers brought the crowd into it. Good back and forth, but no crazy bumps. Del Rio was disqualified, but we weren't sure why. He had Ziggler in a submission, the bell rang, and Del Rio thought he won. But, then he found out he was DQ'ed. After that, Ziggler finished off Del Rio and the show was over.</p><p>My Thoughts: The kids loved the show. I have never seen my daughter like that (8 years), as she was yelling at all the heels... I was surprised the show was not sold out since it was the first time in Windsor... We hung around after the show and Jinder & Heath Slater came out next to the ramp in regular clothes. They were talking to a buddy of theirs. As they drew a crowd, they went back stage.</p><p>Biggest Heat: Del Rio, 2MB, Ryback.</p><p>Biggest Pops: Ziggler, A.J. Lee, Wyatt Family.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_73218.shtml#.Ui1Zxn-SnPg">http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article_73218.shtml#.Ui1Zxn-SnPg</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Second WWE House Show Report 09.07.13 - Windsor, Ontario</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 09.08.2013</p><p>（1） Dolph Ziggler won a battle royal to earn a World Hvt. Championship match. Damien Sandow rolled under the bottom rope early on and then grabbed his Money in the Bank briefcase and walked away. The match came down to Dolph Ziggler, Jinder Mahal, and Heath Slater. Ziggler eventually eliminated both men. Sandow came back and hit Ziggler with the briefcase and threw him over the top rope, but Ziggler held on. Ziggler superkicked Sandow to the back of the head and eliminated him. Ziggler won the match again.</p><p>（8）Dolph Ziggler defeated Alberto Del Rio by DQ in a World Hvt. Championship match. The crowd went nuts for Ziggler all night. Del Rio took a sign from a kid. He teased giving it to different fans a dozen times before ripping it up. He wanted his introduction to be delivered in Spanish and said the fans were stupid for not understanding Spanish. Del Rio ran out of the ring a lot with Ziggler in pursuit. A kid yelled you suck in Del Rio's face a couple of times.</p><p>Del Rio continued to stall and asked Ziggler for a handshake. Ziggler took him down and beat on him and delivered ten elbow drops. Later, Ziggler performed a series of big moves and hit a great looking DDT. Del Rio countered with an arm breaker and a super kick. Ziggler sell so well, it's fantastic. Del Rio applied the Cross Arm Breaker, which Dolph countered. He pushed Del Rio into the corner and the missed a splash. Ziggler came back with the Fameasser for a great near fall. They both got up and Del Rio was DQ'd (presumably for a title belt shot to the head). Del Rio grabbed a chair, but Dolph caught him with the Zig Zag. Dolph high-fived fans at ringside to close the show.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/296786">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/296786</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results (9/7): Windsor, Ontario - Another NXT Talent Makes His WWE Debut</strong></p><p>by Mike Killam September 07, 2013</p><p>(1) Dolph Ziggler won a battle royale that included a dozen guys including the Prime Time Players, Big E Langston, Ryback, Fandango and NXT's Xavier Woods.</p><p>(8) World Heavyweight Championship Match Dolph Ziggler def.
