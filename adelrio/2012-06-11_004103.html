But also I stated I would have professional wrestling thoughts and breaking news from time to time. Like when I broke that the 2012 Royal Rumble would take place in St.Louis months before the WWE made the announcement.<br><br>Now I have more breaking news that none of the dirt sheets, none of the insider wrestling websites know or have reported.<br><br>According to a source very close to the situation, I can confirm that WWE superstar Alberto Del Rio suffered what is being told to me as a “serious concussion” at the company’s Smackdown Tapings on Tuesday June 5th. Kane had to replace Del Rio in the “dark match” main event against Sheamus in a Steel Cage. Kane has replaced Del Rio on the Smackdown house shows for the next week against Sheamus. As of right now there are many high ranking figures in the WWE that do not believe Del Rio will receive medical clearance for June 17th, the date of the WWE Pay-Per-View “No Way Out” in which Del Rio is scheduled to wrestle Sheamus for the World Heavyweight Championship. There is contingency plans being discussed as to who would replace Del Rio at No Way Out, including pulling Kane from the WWE Championship triple threat match against WWE Champion C.M. Punk and Daniel Bryan and placing Kane in a World Heavyweight Championship match with Sheamus. Other plans are to hold a Battle Royal or a “Beat the Clock” series at the June 11th Smackdown tapings to determine Sheamus’ opponent at No Way Out. Word is that VinceMcMahon and Triple H are becoming worried that Alberto Del Rio can not be relied due to injury concerns and is being compared to “Mr.Kennedy” (TNA’s Mr.Anderson) backstage.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://coryradford.blog.com/2012/06/08/breaking-news-wwe-star-out-indefinitely/">http://coryradford.blog.com/2012/06/08/breaking-news-wwe-star-out-indefinitely/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Del Rio Reportedly Suffers Serious Concussion, PPV Contingency Plans Being Made</strong><br><br>By Daniel Pena | June 10, 2012<br><br>A WWE source told sports blog Corey Unfiltered Friday that Alberto Del Rio suffered a "serious concussion" at last Tuesday's SmackDown taping in Columbia, South Carolina. During a skirmish, Sheamus slammed Del Rio's head against the metal WWE logo, leading to his concussion. Kane replaced Del Rio as Sheamus' Steel Cage Match opponent in the post-taping bout and at Saturday's SmackDown live event in Salisbury, Maryland.<br><br>Del Rio's injury puts his World Heavyweight Championship Match against Sheamus at No Way Out on June 17 in jeopardy since WWE officials believe he will not receive medical clearance in time for the pay-per-view event. Contingency plans are being discussed in case Del Rio is unable to compete, including removing Kane from the WWE Championship Match against CM Punk and Daniel Bryan. Other plans broached include a Battle Royal or a Beat the Clock Challenge to take place at this Tuesday's SmackDown taping in Manchester, New Hampshire<br><br>Meanwhile, WWE heads Vince McMahon and Triple H are becoming increasingly worried that Del Rio cannot be relied on due to injury concerns. He is being compared to former WWE star Mr. Kennedy (now known as Mr. Anderson in TNA Wrestling), whose reputation for being injury prone partially led to his release from the organization in 2009.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0610/553349/alberto-del-rio/"></a><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0610/553349/alberto-del-rio/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0610/553349/alberto-del-rio/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>NoDQ.com > WWE > Del Rio Misses House Show; Suffering Concussion<br></strong><br>Posted by Andy Steven on 06/10/2012 at 04:10 AM<br><br>Alberto Del Rio did not appear as scheduled for Saturday’s SmackDown live event in Salisbury, Maryland, which would confirm reports that he suffered a concussion during last Tuesday’s SmackDown taping in Columbia, South Carolina. WWE officials brainstormed alternative scenarios Friday in case Del Rio is unable to wrestle Sheamus at No Way Out on June 17.<br><br>Looking to get under the skin of the World Heavyweight Champion, Del Rio brought out Ricardo Rodriguez on this week’s episode of SmackDown to make light of the Irish brawler by mimicking his distinctive red hair, outfit and gestures. The real Sheamus then appeared, where the fight would eventually spread to the steel stage. The Celtic Warrior slammed Del Rio’s head against the metal WWE logo, leading to his possible concussion.<br><br>At Saturday’s house show, Sheamus defended his strap against the winner of a match pitting Kane against The Great Khali. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/341322564.shtml"></a><a href="http://http://nodq.com/wwe/341322564.shtml">http://nodq.com/wwe/341322564.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>ALBERTO DEL RIO UPDATE</strong><br><br>By Dave Scherer on 2012-06-10 09:09:01<br><br>Alberto Del Rio was pulled from his house show match against Sheamus in Salisbury, MD last night. It appears the report that we had yesterday about him suffering a concussion at Tuesday's Smackdown taping is true. If so, and he can't work at next weekend's No Way Out PPV, WWE will figure out whether to put Kane or someone else in the World Title match this week. Boy they sure are dropping like flies in Stamford.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=69180">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=69180</a> <br></p>
