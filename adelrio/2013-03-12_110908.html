LESNAR HAPPENING?; RYBACK AND MARK HENRY FIND A NEW TOY; TWO DIVAS RETURN; AT THE MOVIES; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-03-11 21:04:51</p><p>PREVIOUSLY on Raw, Triple H made a challenge to Brock Lesnar for one more match at Wrestlemania. We saw that The Shield is vulnerable. We saw the New Age Outlaws prove that they might be Old School, but they can beat Nueva Escuela Primo y Epico. The Undertaker made his return and we found out that CM Punk is the man who will get a chance to prevent Undertaker from going 21 for 21 at the Biggest Show of the Year.</p><p>What will happen when the reunited New Age Outlaws face the reunited Rhodes Scholars? Will CM Punk use the passing of Paul Bearer to up the ante for his match with Undertaker? Will Brock Lesnar (or Paul Heyman) accept Triple H’s challenge?</p><p>We are in Indianapolis, Indiana and your announcers are Michael ‘Gene Keady is jealous of Donald Trump’s hair’ Cole and Jerry ‘Larry Bird’ Lawler.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio walks through the back with Ricardo Rodriguez and the bucket as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and it is time to talk about The Call, coming to a theater near you where you didn’t see Dead Man Down last weekend.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio is in the Goldman Box. He says that he was born in Mexico but he was made in America.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: Antonio Cesaro versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Champion versus Champion Match</strong></p><p>They lock up and Cesaro with a hammer lock and he backs Del Rio into the corner and he kicks and punches him. Del Rio with boots to Cesaro followed by a rana. Del Rio is sent to the apron and Del Rio with a kick. Del Rio with a cross body from the top for a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the leg and then he goes to the turnbuckles but Cesaro with a leg sweep to pull him off the turnbuckles.</p><p>Cesaro with kicks to Del Rio. Cesaro gets a near fall. Cesaro with knees and an Irish whip followed by a running European uppercut. Cesaro gets a near fall and follows with more elbow drops. Cesaro with a reverse chin lock. Cesaro with another knee to Del Rio but he misses a shoulder in the corner. Del Rio with two clotheslines and he avoids one from Cesaro and then Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a super kick and he gets a near fall.</p><p>Cesaro with a kick and then Del Rio sends Cesaro to the apron and he hits a series of forearms followed by a lungblower for a near fall. Del Rio goes up top. Cesaro with a European uppercut to Del Rio as he comes off the turnbuckles and Cesaro gets a near fall. Cesaro with a boot to the head and then he tries for a dead lift German suplex but Del Rio hits the float over into the cross arm breaker and Cesaro taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>Michael Cole mentions the YouTube videos that Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez did to parody Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter.</p><p>Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter are walking in the back and they are not happy as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back with another Paul Bearer memory. Paul with Mr. Fuji and Nick Turturro</p><p>Zeb says that him and Jack are not in a good mood. There are big problems in this country and he is looking at one of them now. Mr. Sin Cara or is it Senor Sin Cara. For someone who did not have the decency to learn the language. The people are programmed to cheer him because he has a nice little entrance and he bounces around the ring like a nice little Mexican Jumping Bean. He says that people are thinking like him about Sin Cara. They know what he is. He is a thief. Every night, somewhere 365 nights a year there is a Sin Cara with his band of amigos sneaking across the border trying to take something from an American.</p><p>Zeb says that it is everyone’s fault that this is happening because nobody is saying anything about it. He is not afraid and Jack Swagger is not afraid.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio says that he was born in Mexico but made in America. The only thing that Alberto has made is make them aware. They are aware of how many things are wrong in this country.</p><p>Jack says that he will bring the World Title back where it belongs. He welcomes everyone to Jack Swagger’s America.</p><p><strong>Match Number Nine: Jack Swagger (with Zeb Colter) versus Sin Cara</strong></p><p>Cara with kicks to Swagger and a handspring back elbow. Swagger catches Cara but they both go over the top rope and Swagger goes to the floor. Cara with a baseball slide and then he hits a double jump cross body onto Swagger.</p><p>Swagger attacks the ring steps before returning to the ring. Cara with a kick and boots to Swagger. Cara tries for a sunset flip but Swagger blocks it. Cara with an enzuigiri and he goes for a springboard cross body but Swagger with a boot to the chest. Swagger starts to work on the leg. Swagger applies the ankle lock and Cara taps out.</p><p>Winner: Jack Swagger</p><p>After the match, Swagger refuses to release the hold and Del Rio comes to the ring and he goes after Swagger. Del Rio applies the cross arm breaker but Colter pulls Swagger out of the ring.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=76041">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=76041</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
