Championship. There were kendo sticks and chairs in use. Del Rio got the win after Ziggler failed to answer the 10 count, but Dolph sent Del Rio through a table to send the fans home happy.</p><p>Notes: Most of the matches were pretty standard fare, but there were a ton of kids there who were into the action and that made it fun. There was also tons of John Cena merchandise sold even though he wasn't there. I had had a picture taken with WWE Hall of Famer Bon Backlund and got it signed for $30 bucks. It was pretty cool to meet a guy that was champ when I was a kid growing up! A fun night in Ocean City.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/289871">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/289871</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From Ocean City (7/6): Briscoes At Show, Del Rio Defends</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | July 07, 2013</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader @MooseMcNamara for sending in these results from Saturday's WWE live event in Ocean City, MD:</p><p>House was mostly full, but it was a smaller venue inside the Roland E. Powell Convention Center in Ocean City. I would say 1,000 to 1,500 fans, but that could be off, just a guess.</p><p>And finally the Main Event of the evening:</p><p>Alberto Del Rio vs. Dolph Ziggler (Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship)</p><p>ADR was out first after a pre-recorded video message from the currently suspended Ricardo Rodriguez. Much heat for Del Rio accompanied by many "USA" chants which Del Rio played off of during the bout. The roof came off when Ziggler came out and the two started off the match with a lot of playing the crowd. After some physicality, Del Rio acted like he was leaving. For some random reason, the crowd started chanting "BODYSLAM" at Dolph who looked puzzled by this at first but then gave a 'hold on one second' hand gesture. He chased down Del Rio to the ramp and delivered the aforementioned bodyslam. It was a highly entertaining moment, and good for Ziggler for listening to the fans quite literally. They did some spots with a kendo stick and a steel chair wedged between the middle and top rope in the corner. Del Rio got a table at one point and set it up in the corner, but it was not used during the match. The match ended with a stiff cresent kick from Del Rio to a kneeling Dolph Ziggler who was then down for the ten count. Del Rio showboated with the title as Dolph got back to his feet and threw Alberto through the table in the corner. Ziggler got up on the turnbuckle and held the World Title as the crowd ate it up. Ziggler slapped hands with everyone around the ring, and he passed me, I jokingly said, "Do you even lift, bro?" He responded with a sarcastic, "Nice."</p><p>Overall standard B-show. 4 out of 10.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0707/563929/wwe-live-event-results/index-2.shtml">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0707/563929/wwe-live-event-results/index-2.shtml</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
