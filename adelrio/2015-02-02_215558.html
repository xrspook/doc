RODERICK STRONG AND MORE: 1/31 RING OF HONOR IN DAYTON, OHIO LIVE REPORT</strong></p><p>By Trent Van Drisse on 2015-02-01 16:04:43</p><p>My wife and I attended last nights ROH house show in Dayton, Ohio, out second time seeing ROH at this venue. It drew a good sized crowd, pretty much all the seats were full, and some people were standing along the walls. This is a hard show to rate, it felt unimportant, and was uneven both in match quality and star power.</p><p>On the other side of the coin however it had two great matches on it, so on the strength of that I guess I'd give it an upper thumbs in the middle, but I could easily be swayed either way to be honest.</p><p>7 Alberto El Patron beat Roderick Strong by submission. The show momentum bounced right back here, as did the before mentioned star power. In my mind El Patron isn't really a ROH style worker, but man he looked like he fit right in here. He and Strong worked beautifully together, and the crowd came back to life and loved it. Despite them working so well together though, both guys came out of this one nicked up, as it was a rough match. El Patron appeared to go head first to the floor on a Tope, which was scary. He had a little blood coming out of the top of his head after that, but did not appear to be loopy. Strong had a bloody nose and/or mouth going too. Strong also came into this match with his left shoulder heavily taped up, though he ripped the tape off very early in the contest. El Patron got the win with with the cross arm breaker submission, the second time he applied it was the charm. Great match!</p><p>Whitmer & Jacobs attacked Strong after the match, but El Patron made the save, and El Patron and Strong then shook hands and hugged happily.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=91282">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=91282</a></p>
