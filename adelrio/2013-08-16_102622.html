I realized writing my book, that there's a huge latino community in the US and I wanted to bring a strong lucha libre style to the WWE to bridge the cultural gap. But it didn't happen. That's one of the first big fights I had with Vince.</p><p>The concept of the masked wrestler is lost on the WWE, they don't really understand it, they don't appreciate it, unlike Mexico where that's the focal point. I think in America, it's a whole different ballgame, the psychology is different. I lost that fight a couple of times in the room. At one point, we lost Ultimo he went back to Japan, and we just had Rey, Vince goes, 'We have one masked wrestler in the ring, any more of them on the roster and it'll confuse the fans.' I said to him, 'Vince, there's 10,000 wrestlers in Mexico in masks, no-one's confused.' I looked around the room and I wasn't gonna win that fight. That was the biggest disappointment, that they wouldn't let lucha libre be a featured style on the show."</p><p><strong>On Alberto Del Rio's decision as opposed to other Mexican stars:</strong> "<strong>He took the mask off which was a smart move, a very smart move. If you're gonna come up from Mexico with a famous gimmick, take the mask off, find a different gimmick don't lose the reputation, that's the awful thing.</strong> It's like Ultimo Dragon, he never got the push he deserved because they never knew what to do with him. At one point a few years ago, WWE wanted him to come back but wanted him to take his mask off. It seems like people don't get how important the mask is in Mexico, it's like the essence of the wrestler. Mistico, I think Sin Cara now, he made a big splash, now they don't know what to do with him. Think of merchandising with a masked wrestler, it could be huge. But they don't understand the lucha libre mentality."</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article10032831.shtml">http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article10032831.shtml</a></p>
