They had an estimated turn-out of 800 people. Very nice guys, and Goldust was even a good sport when giving him a hard time about his Dallas Cowboys losing. Cody laughed at him and teased him as well.</p><p>Note from Stephen: The arena was about two-thirds full of fairly enthusiastic fans. I liked the new (to me) house show set, which included a lighted stage with ramp, a mini-tron sandwiched between two smaller video screens, and smoke machines. The house show presentations continue to improve.</p><p>(5) Dolph Ziggler beat Alberto Del Rio. Amazing, outstanding, physical back-and-forth match that really played to the crowd. Both wrestlers had the crowd involved from throwing their shirts to every nearfall. Ziggler won with Zig-Zag after reversing the Cross Armbreaker. Ziggler had a huge reaction and he really should be higher on the card. The crowd loved him.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_75459.shtml#.UsizlftKcjQ">http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article_75459.shtml#.UsizlftKcjQ</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>NoDQ.com WWE MVP Says No Chance for Rumble, Ziggler-Rio Note</strong></p><p>Posted by Steve Carrier on 01/04/2014 at 01:01 PM</p><p>The Dolph Ziggler vs. Alberto Del Rio match at last night's WWE live event in Fayetteville, North Carolina reportedly stole the show. Ziggler ended up getting the win.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/390865201.shtml">http://nodq.com/wwe/390865201.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>1/3 WWE IN FAYETTEVILLE, NC RESULTS</strong></p><p>By Bryce Morvel on 2014-01-04 02:14:00</p><p>I attended the first WWE show of the year tonight here in Fayetteville. It was a solid show but felt like we were extras at a QVC convention with all the stuff they hawked.</p><p>I wouldn't say it was awesome but the kids that were there liked it, which since they are pushing for that audience, is what it about these days. I've been to a ton of old NWA shows over the years and then WCW after that. This was the first time in years I went to a WWE show and I only did because my friend had an extra. It's sad how its more like Harlem Globetrotters then ever, but that's the way of the world.</p><p>Dolph Ziggler pinned Alberto Del Rio with a Zig Zag.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=82584">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=82584</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2014-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2014</a></p>
