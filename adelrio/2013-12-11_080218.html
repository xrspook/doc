At a star-studded press conference held at the Santa Clara Convention Center, it was announced by the city of Santa Clara, WWE officials and many of WWE’s biggest Superstars that WrestleMania 31 will take place on March 29, 2015, at the brand-new Levi’s Stadium. It was also announced that WrestleMania Week activities including Axxess, the 2015 Hall of Fame Ceremony and Monday Night Raw will be held in nearby San Jose.</p><p>"Silicon Valley was founded by inspirational people that were visionaries, people that weren't afraid to push boundaries. Let me tell you, we have people that are visionaries and legendary, in fact," Santa Clara Mayor Jamie Matthews said of WWE. "I'm very excited that Silicon Valley and Santa Clara will host WWE's premier event, WrestleMania 31, on March 29, 2015, across the street at Levi's Stadium."</p><p>Joining Mayor Matthews for the announcement were WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon, Executive Vice President of Special Events John Saboor and a host of WWE Superstars, including World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, Alberto Del Rio, Big Show, The Bella Twins, Mark Henry, The Great Khali and Sheamus. Before the event, Fandango and Summer Rae showed off their best dance moves.</p><p>"WrestleMania should be on everyone's bucket list," the WWE Chairman said. "If you haven't seen a WrestleMania, you haven't seen anything like it or felt anything like it. I assure you WrestleMania will rival, if not supersede, the Super Bowl or anything else that will be in that extraordinary facility."</p><p>Also in attendance were Patricia Ernstrom, executive director of the San Jose Sports Authority, Jed York, owner and CEO of the San Francisco 49ers, and tight end Vernon Davis of the 49ers. WWE Superstar R-Truth also showed the crowd “what’s up” with one of his trademark raps.</p><p>"It’s very rare to find anyone in the world that does not have a wrestling story," Stephanie McMahon said. "Wrestling seems to have touched everyone’s lives in some form or fashion, whether it be through grandparents or parents or siblings. This is truly a unique experience and there is nothing like it in the world. We couldn’t be more excited to bring it here for WrestleMania 31."</p><p></p><p>More than 70,000 fans are expected to descend upon Silicon Valley for the week-long festivities. In addition to WrestleMania 31, the San Jose Convention Center will play host to WrestleMania Axxess, the four-day fan festival. The 2015 WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and Monday Night Raw will take place at San Jose’s SAP Center. WWE is also sure to give back to the local community through pro-social activities like Be a STAR anti-bullying rallies, the WrestleMania Reading Challenge, hospital visits and other charitable endeavors.</p><p>"In its infancy, WWE advertised WrestleMania as the greatest event of WWE," World Heavyweight Champion John Cena said. "I’ve watched WrestleMania grow and mature. WrestleMania is now an experience. Cities in years past like Detroit, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, New York, soon to be New Orleans, and I’m proud and excited to say Silicon Valley, find out what that experience is. WWE is an entertainment field of dreams. When you build it, they will come."</p><p>Earlier this year, WrestleMania 29 generated $101.2 million in economic impact for the New York/New Jersey area. More than 80,600 fans from all 50 states and 34 countries made WrestleMania 29 the highest grossing entertainment event in MetLife Stadium history. WrestleMania XXX takes place on April 6, 2014 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.</p><p>Levi’s Stadium, set to open in August 2014, will be the new home of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers. It is easily accessible from several major highways, as well as public transportation including buses, light rail and trains.</p><p>"At the end of the day, I guarantee you'll have a smile on your face," the WWE Chairman added.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/31/levis-stadium-to-host-wrestlemania-31-26168989">http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/31/levis-stadium-to-host-wrestlemania-31-26168989</a></p>
