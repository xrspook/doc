After coming up short against John Cena at Survivor Series, Alberto Del Rio looked to get back on track against Dolph Ziggler. Fresh off his victory in a Hamptons Hardcore Match on Raw, Damien Sandow took on Santino Marella. Also, Kofi Kingston faced Fandango once again, this time without The Miz at ringside to interfere.</p><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio def. Dolph Ziggler</strong></p><p>WWE Main Event kicked off with a clash between two former World Heavyweight Champions. Dolph Ziggler and Alberto Del Rio rekindled their rivalry, with bragging rights on the line Wednesday night. The Mexican Aristocrat controlled the early moments of the match, working over Ziggler’s neck.</p><p>Though The Showoff had already been through a vicious Hamptons Hardcore Match on Raw, he showed no signs of weakness Wednesday night. Ziggler regained his composure and hit Del Rio with 10 consecutive elbow drops to the delight of the WWE Universe. However, Del Rio soon cut Ziggler off with a devastating tilt-a-whirl backbreaker.</p><p>Ziggler was able to send Del Rio crashing to the arena floor with a dropkick, but was soon sent shoulder-first into the ringside barricade himself. The Mexican Aristocrat quickly took the match back into the ring and took control. The Showoff was able to get in quick bursts of offense, but Del Rio was always able to pounce back on the attack shortly after.</p><p>It looked as though Ziggler was going to turn things around after he countered a top-rope attack from Del Rio with another dropkick. The Showoff followed up with a big splash in the corner and a flurry of right hands. On Wednesday night, however, Del Rio would not stay down.</p><p>Ziggler went to the top ropes in hopes of finishing the match. Del Rio got back to his feet and hit a breathtaking reverse suplex from the middle rope. The Showoff valiantly fought back to his feet, but once The Mexican Aristocrat locked on the Cross Armbreaker, Ziggler was left with no choice but to tap out.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwemainevent/2013-11-27/results-26167192">http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwemainevent/2013-11-27/results-26167192</a></p><p></p><p>'Main Event' Results Could Del Rio Shut Down The Showoff?</p><p>Former World Heavyweight Champions collided on WWE Main Event, as Alberto Del Rio battled Dolph Ziggler. Was The Mexican Aristocrat able to get back on track following his Survivor Series loss to John Cena, or was The Showoff able to pull off the win?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Could Del Rio Shut Down The Showoff?</p><p>Former World Heavyweight Champions collided on WWE Main Event, as Alberto Del Rio battled Dolph Ziggler.
