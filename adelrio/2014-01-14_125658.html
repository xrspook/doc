Bray asks if you heard the good news. He needed him. He needed him. He was lost. Now, he has a home. Your words mean nothing to him now. Daniel on hears his truth. Now he has a home.</p><p>We are in Providence, Rhode Island and your announcers are Michael ‘Want to know how to get the WWE Network’ Cole, John ‘I wish there was someone who could tell us how to get the WWE Network’ Layfield, and Jerry ‘Is there a way to get the WWE Network’ Lawler.</p><p>Rey Mysterio walks in the back as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back with a Batista video package. Remember that he is coming back next week.</p><p>Rey Mysterio appeared in the Goldman Box and he says that he lasted the longest in the Royal Rumble match when he won and he will win again.</p><p><strong>Match Number Eight: Rey Mysterio versus Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>They lock up and Del Rio with a kick and punches to Rey. Del Rio with a slam for a near fall. Rey with a head scissors that sends Alberto into the ropes but Del Rio cannot bounce away from the ropes and he gets stuck. Del Rio gets to the floor when Rey starts for the 619. Rey with a seated splash off the apron.</p><p>Rey goes up top and he hits another seated splash. Del Rio with a back heel kick. Del Rio with a sunset flip but Rey rolls through and kicks Del Rio in the head and gets a near fall. Del Rio with divorce court and then he punches Rey. Del Rio with an arm bar.</p><p>Rey with a forearm but Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio wraps the arm in the ropes and the referee warns Alberto. Del Rio with an Irish whip but Del Rio goes for a shoulder into the corner but Rey moves and Del Rio hits the post and Del Rio falls to the floor.</p><p>Del Rio runs into boots from Rey. Del Rio gets sent into the ropes on a head scissors and Rey hits the 619 but Del Rio stops Rey and Rey hangs from the turnbuckles. Del Rio with a super kick to the back of the head. Del Rio calls for the cross arm breaker and he applies it and Rey taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Alberto asks Batista what he thinks about what happened to his friend Rey Mysterio. If Batista shows up next week, the same thing will happen to him. The Hero will become a Zero after Alberto eliminates Batista in the Royal Rumble. The ignorance will end and people will talk about Alberto Del Rio.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=82821">http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=82821</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2014-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2014</a></p>
