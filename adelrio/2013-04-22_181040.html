But hey, it worked, with the duo getting the biggest heel heat of the night so far. Surprise, surprise - Coulter was banned from ringside following the fans' poll. The crowd ate up Ricardo's Rodriguez's ring introduction, and ADR got a nice pop as well. The end of the match came after Swagger had been working Alberto over with a kendo stick and put him through a table (which the crowd reacted well for), before Del Rio managed to lock in a flash cross armbar for the submission win.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=77079">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=77079</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE House Show Results 04.21.13 - Sheffield, England</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 04.21.2013</p><p>The results were very similar to dates earlier in the week.
