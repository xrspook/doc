O'Connor and Paul M. for sending in these results from tonight's SmackDown tapings at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, IN:</p><p>Attendance is low, I've been a wrestling fan for 22 years and this is the lowest attendance I've ever seen for a WWE TV Taping. Attendance looks to be around 4,000.</p><p>SmackDown opens with the Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon, who announces that the new GM of SmackDown is a man who will call it down the middle... Booker T! Booker comes out to a nice pop. Alberto Del Rio comes out and starts talking. Out comes Sheamus, who tells Del Rio that he's happy about his upbringing and that he's not a rich punk like Del Rio. Booker tells Sheamus and Del Rio that they have single matches tonight before being stopped by Del Rio, who says he will not wrestle until SummerSlam. Booker tells Del Rio that he's the new boss and tonight he faces Randy Orton. Booker then tells Sheamus that he will face his opponent right now and it's... TENSAI.</p><p>Striker is backstage with Randy Orton. Orton guarantees he will hit Del Rio with an RKO tonight.</p><p>Main event time! Randy Orton comes out to a nice ovation followed by Ricardo Rodriguez, who introduces Alberto Del Rio. Lots of "Orton" chants throughout the match. Del Rio does a good job of keeping Orton grounded during the bout. Orton gets his second win and is preparing for an RKO when Ricardo runs in, causing a DQ. Del Rio attacks Orton's arm, but Orton fights him off and sends him outside the ring. As Del Rio tries to leave, Sheamus runs out and throws Del Rio back in the ring where he gets an RKO! End of show.</p></blockquote><p>`<a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0731/554862/wwe-smackdown-spoilers/index-2.shtml">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0731/554862/wwe-smackdown-spoilers/index-2.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Complete WWE Smackdown Taping Results (SPOILERS)</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 07.31.2012</p><p>The Smackdown announcers were introduced. However, Booker T was not with them. This is likely part of the general manager angle that was teased earlier by WWE's text service.</p><p>Vince McMahon announced Booker as the new general manager. Alberto Del Rio came out to talk about not competing until Summerslam. Sheamus came out and they exchanged words. Booker booked Del Rio vs Orton for later, and Sheamus vs Tensai immediately.</p><p>Striker interviewed Randy Orton backstage and welcomed him back to the show. Orton mentioned Alberto Del Rio being number one contender for the World Title. Orton said he'll defeat Del Rio tonight.</p><p>Randy Orton defeated Alberto Del Rio (w/Ricardo Rodriguez) by DQ. Ricardo entered the ring and attacked Orton as he was going to set up the RKO, which caused the DQ finish. They both went up the ramp when Sheamus ran down behind Del Rio, threw him inside the ring, and into Orton's RKO. Orton posed as the taping ended.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/248806">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/248806</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>NoDQ.com > WWE > Spoilers: Smackdown Taping Results for 8/3/12</strong></p><p>Posted by Steve Carrier on 07/31/2012 at 08:26 PM</p><p>Tonight WWE will tape this week's episode of WWE Smackdown from the Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana.
