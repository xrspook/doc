There was a pre match promo by Barrett telling us to acknowledge his existence. And that since we picked a no DQ, we are a city of barbarians, which is a fair assessment. There was a decent face reaction for Del Rio. Barrett used heel tactics early on. He kept rolling out if the ring. There was a quick flurry from Del Rio. Barrett took control when he pulled a kendo stick or and pummeled Del Rio.</p><p>A chair was brought in and Barrett want to town on Del Rio, who had a hope spot until Barrett threw him into the turnbuckle. They did the boo/yeah spot with Del Rio taking over. Del Rio picked up the kendo stick and got his revenge. Del Rio went for the cross arm breaker but it got reversed into a sick Winds of Change with a good near fall. Del Rio got a table out and the place went nuts. As he set it up, Barrett threw him into the buckle again. Barrett put him on the table and he went to the top rope and Ricardo jumped up and hit him with the pail and Del Rio hit him with a bulldog through the table for the win.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/273060">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/273060</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From Louisville (2/10) - Orton Teams With Sheamus, Barrett Vs. Del Rio</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri February 11, 2013</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Andrew D. for sending in these results from last night's SmackDown live event in Louisville, KY. Douglas Bennett contributed to this article.</p><p>The event started off with everyone rising for the National Anthem. There was a poll for the main event champion vs. champion match Alberto Del Rio and Wade Barret. The choices were either No DQ or 2 out of 3 falls.</p><p>The main event between Alberto Del Rio and Wade Barret was voted to be a NO DQ match. Alberto came out to a decent pop while Wade got major heat. He cut a heel promo before the match. The match itself was great, although Wade looked like he dislocated his shoulder early on. Kendo sticks, a chair, a table and Ricardo's bucket were used. Match ended when Wade and Alberto were on the top turnbuckle with the table set out in front of it. Wade was gonna send Alberto through the table but Ricardo hit him with his bucket which allowed Alberto to bulldog Wade through the table and retain his title to send the fans home happy. Afterward Alberto posed with his title for a bit and spent some time with the fans before exiting.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0211/560279/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0211/560279/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
