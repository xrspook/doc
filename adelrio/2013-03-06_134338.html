Alberto Del Rio interrupts and shows us a clip of he and Ricardo Rodriguez doing a spoof of Zeb and Swagger's "We The People" videos.</p><p>Matt Striker interviews Dolph Ziggler, who says he's going to make history tonight.</p><p>Ricardo Rodriguez came out and told everyone to help draw out Alberto Del Rio's name for as long as they could later.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio beat Dolph Ziggler by submission in a solid match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0305/560909/live-spoilers-for-this-week-wwe-smackdown/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0305/560909/live-spoilers-for-this-week-wwe-smackdown/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SmackDown Spoilers: Results and Analysis for March 8 Edition</strong></p><p>By Daniel Van Boom(Featured Columnist) on March 5, 2013</p><p>WWE taped this week's episode of WWE SmackDown from the Times Union Center in Albany, New York.</p><p>ack Swagger and Zeb Colter kick the show off with a promo that's interrupted by Alberto Del Rio. Del Rio shows a clip of he and Ricardo Rodriguez doing a parody video of Colter and Swagger's "We The People" clips.</p><p>Backstage Segments Ziggler, with Big E Langston and AJ Lee, is interviewed by Matt Striker. Dolph says that he'll make history tonight by beating Del Rio. After the interview he gets some cheap heat via a kiss from AJ.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio vs Dolph Ziggler</p><p>Alberto Del Rio defeated Dolph Ziggler with the Cross Armbar in what was described as an excellent match.</p><p>During the match Big E chased Ricardo around the ring and tried to throw water at him but it went all over AJ instead, who then chased Ricardo around the ring as well. AJ and Big E were both ejected.</p><p>This match was set up by last week's "Social Media SmackDown", so I suppose we've got the fans to blame for Ziggler suffering what feels like his 100th consecutive loss to Alberto Del Rio.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1555196-wwe-smackdown-spoilers-results-and-analysis-for-march-8-edition">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1555196-wwe-smackdown-spoilers-results-and-analysis-for-march-8-edition</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Complete WWE Smackdown Taping Results (SPOILERS)</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 03.05.2013</p><p>Jack Swagger and Zeb Coulter cut a promo trying to convince everyone that they thought just like they did. He said we're the problem too if we don't agree. Alberto Del Rio interrupted and threw to a clip of Ricardo and Alberto mocking Coulter's YouTube video and talking about Mexican food. Pretty funny stuff.</p><p>Ricardo Rodriguez came to the stage and told everyone in the crowd to deliver the "Albertoooo" a long as they could when Del Rio came out.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio beat Dolph Ziggler with the Cross Armbreaker. Good back and forth match with lots of near falls. Ricardo dumped a bucket of water on AJ, but Langston and AJ got sent to the back for it.</p><p>Backstage, Daniel Bryan told AJ she looked like a wet puppy. She said that she's with the next world champion now. She said Bryan's reign ended in 18 seconds. Bryan said that being with Ziggler, she should be used to 18 seconds.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/275864">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/275864</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
