This match was supposed to be between Del Rio and Sheamus, but instead, the WWE is going to provide their loyal fanbase a match that they really want to see. <br><br>However, only half of the work has been done. Although the WWE loves to give their fans the matches they want, it's the results that truly matter to the WWE Universe.<br><br>Many fans have been known to call both Orton and Del Rio stale as of late. Some call the Viper a "robot" or "Super Orton" because of how predictable and boring his matches have been. On the other hand, when Del Rio returned from injury, not too many people were very excited about the result. <br><br>What is the best way to maximize the potential out of both of these WWE superstars?<br><br>By having Del Rio and Orton successfully complete a double-turn. <br><br>Now, if you are new to the wrestling world and you don't understand half the things us writers or fans are saying, then you might not now what a double-turn means. A double-turn, as defined by Wikipedia is: <br> The rare occurrence when both the babyface and the heel switch roles during an angle or a match. An example of this is the Bret Hart/Steve Austin match at WrestleMania 13 and the Powers of Pain/Demolition at Survivor Series 1988.<br><br>Both Orton and Del Rio could easily pull off the turns. We know how successful Orton was as a heel. It actually suits him a lot more to be a heel than to be some stale face that just beats up on jobbers. On the other hand, Del Rio was a face while wrestling in Mexico. If he was able to pull off a face in Mexico, he could easily pull off a face gimmick in the WWE. <br><br>If Del Rio turned face and Orton turned heel, then both of them would be given a fresh look which would then open the doors to newer and more exciting feuds.<br><br>For starters, the Viper and the Mexican Aristocrat would feud with each other after the Over the Limit PPV. For this double-turn to be successful, Orton would have to win the match dirty over Del Rio, so it only makes sense to put the belt around Orton's waist. <br><br>The night after on Raw, Sheamus would get his re-match against Orton and lose because of an interference from Jericho. Both Sheamus and Jericho would then get into a nice feud with each other as well. Del Rio would then be given a chance at the belt because he won the battle royal that same night on Raw. <br><br>After their feud, Del Rio could then move on to face a heel like a Cody Rhodes, Daniel Bryan or if he sticks around, Jericho.<br><br>It's time to finally push the newer faces in the WWE because this bringing back former WWE superstars for a year or two will finally catch up to the company and leave all the true talent behind. <br><br>If you have Orton as a heel, he could put over some up and coming faces and also be featured in PPV's against the big time faces. Hopefully, this won't produce a Cena vs. Orton match for the 88th time, but it could produce other great feuds.<br><br>If you have Del Rio as a face, he could be put over by veteran heels and finally become the household name the WWE wanted him to be. <br><br>If the double-turn were done right with Orton and Del Rio at Over the Limit, the WWE would see a massive spike in overall crowd interest and satisfaction. However, it is very important that it is done right, because if it is not, the crowd won't buy it and the creative team would look like complete fools. <br><br>The WWE has a grand opportunity of producing the first double-turn since WrestleMania 13, and if they do pull it off, not only will the crowd react positively, but the Internet Wrestling Community would go into a frenzy. </p></blockquote><p>转载自：<a target="_blank" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1175978-wwe-over-the-limit-fatal-four-way-ending-should-turn-orton-heel-del-rio-face">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1175978-wwe-over-the-limit-fatal-four-way-ending-should-turn-orton-heel-del-rio-face</a><br></p>
