AMBROSE; THE HIGHLIGHT REEL; WHO IS KAITLYN'S "SPECIAL FELLA"?; MARK HENRY DOES WHAT HE DO; THE WORLD'S LARGEST LUCHADORE; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-05-10 22:00:02</p><p>Over the last few weeks, we have seen a change in Ryback. He has become more surly and has started to wear leather jackets. What will happen when he steps into the Highlight Reel? Jack Swagger attacked people with a ladder on Monday night. What will happen tonight when the triple threat ladder match build heats up. Daniel Bryan will face Dean Ambrose tonight. Who will evolve and who will be shown the gate?</p><p>We are in Raleigh, North Carolina and your announcers are Michael ‘Jordan’ Cole, John ‘North Cakalakey’ Layfield, and Josh ‘In a Research Triple Threat’ Mathews.</p><p>Renee Young is in the back with Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter. Renee brings up Raw but Zeb interrupts and he says that he wants Renee to hold the mic so he can talk. Dolph Ziggler is a man of questionable morals and he won the Money in the Bank ladder match last year. Zeb mentions the criminale Alberto Del Rio and he has experience with ladders. Jack Swagger served a statement on Monday night because he took out four guys. He will send another message taking care of blondie’s bodyguard. At Extreme Rules, every step that Jack Swagger takes up that ladder, every Real American will be a step closer to their goals. The American Way is staying true to your beliefs and taking things one step at a time. Taking the title is the first step and taking the country back is the second step.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio comes to ringside to join the commentary team for the next match.</p><p><strong>Match Number Two: Big E Langston (with lots of chalk, Dolph Ziggler and AJ Lee) versus Jack Swagger (with Zeb Colter)</strong></p><p>Before the match starts, Del Rio brings a ladder from under the ring and he pushes it into the middle of the ring. The referee yells at Del Rio and then Swagger and Ziggler go for the ladder but Swagger with a kick to the head. Langston and Swagger play tug of war with the ladder and Colter hits Langston from behind.</p><p>Langston looks at Colter while holding on to the ladder but Swagger hits Langston in the midsection with the ladder. Ziggler goes after Swagger and he picks up the ladder and tosses it to Swagger and connects with a drop kick into the ladder and Swagger goes down.</p><p>Colter grabs the ladder and Ziggler with a baseball slide into the ladder and Colter is down. Del Rio attacks Ziggler and then he hits the super kick. Del Rio picks up the ladder and he waits for Ziggler to get up and he hits Ziggler in the shoulder with the ladder. Del Rio goes to the floor and he throws the ladder at Swagger.</p><p>Del Rio brings the ladder back into the ring and he grabs the title belt and he climbs the ladder with the belt.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/77473/wwe-smackdown-report-bryan-vs-ambrose-the-highlight-reel-who-is-kaitlyns-special-fella-mark-henry-does-what-he-do-the-worlds-largest-luchadore-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/77473/wwe-smackdown-report-bryan-vs-ambrose-the-highlight-reel-who-is-kaitlyns-special-fella-mark-henry-does-what-he-do-the-worlds-largest-luchadore-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
