Then we hear AJ’s announcement that we will have a Triple Threat Match at SummerSlam for the WWE Title.</p><p>We are live from San Antonio, Texas and your announcers are Michael ‘What about David Robinson Appreciation Night’ Cole and Jerry ‘I wonder if Pee Wee Herman will be here tonight or did he find the basement in the Alamo’ Lawler. </p><p>We go to the back and Alberto Del Rio is trying to park. Ricardo yells at the people in the back to move the table. Ricardo opens the door and he tries to explain the situation to Alberto but Alberto yells at Ricardo and tells him to go.</p><p>AJ is in her office and Alberto and Ricardo enter. Alberto says that AJ is doing a fantastic job as the new General Manager of Raw, unlike the job that Booker T is doing on Smackdown. Alberto says that both of them know that he doesn’t have do anything before SummerSlam.</p><p>AJ says that she doesn’t have anything for Alberto.</p><p>Alberto says something is crazy and AJ overreacts and she says that Alberto has a match and it is next. Alberto is not happy and he yells at Ricardo to get his bags.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>Match Number Two: Christian versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</p><p>Christian punches Del Rio in the turnbuckles and Del Rio goes to the floor. He pulls Christian to the floor and sends Christian into the ring post. Del Rio Irish whips Christian into the ringside barrier before returning to the ring and Del Rio gets a near fall.

Ricardo distracts Christian and gives Del Rio time to recover and he hits Christian with his boot and then applies the cross arm breaker and gets Christian to tap out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Sheamus gets Bertie’s attention. He says that Alberto was right that he is beneath him so he is going to do something about that. He will start with the car. He tells Ricardo not to leave the keys in the car the next time he gets Alberto’s gear. Sheamus says that he is going to take the car on a sight seeing tour of San Antonio. Sheamus says that he feels classier already. </p><p>Michael Cole reminds us of what Sheamus did to Alberto Del Rio’s vehicle earlier in the night. </p><p>Michael Cole reminds us one more time that Sheamus stole Alberto Del Rio’s car. Michael shows us Sheamus’ tout from the Alamo. </p><p>We are back and did you know that Sheamus stole Alberto Del Rio’s car? We have the Touts to prove it. </p><p>We are back and Sheamus is back with the BertieMobile. Sheamus says that is a better ride than his mule. He tells a backstage worker to take care of the car.</p><p>We see Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez in the back and they see what happened to the car. Alberto blames Ricardo for what happened and he tells Ricardo to clean up this mess. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=70858">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=70858</a></p>
