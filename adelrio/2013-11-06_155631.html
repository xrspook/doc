The whole upper level was covered.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio called out John Cena. Cena came out and said that he was ready to go, but Vickie Guerrero said "not so fast" and there will be no title match tonight. Cena vs. Del Rio will happen for the title at Survivor Series. Vickie sets up Del Rio vs. The Great Khali and Cena v Ryback, "as it is best for business."</p><p>Alberto Del Rio defeated The Great Khali.</p><p>John Cena defeated Ryback with the AA. After the match, Del Rio laid out Cena and worked over his left arm. The taping ended here.</p><p>Dark match:</p><p>The referee started the dark match main event between Cena and Del Rio, which Cena won. After the match, Cena played to the crowd by seeing which section yelled the loudest. He later took time to mention that a Make-A-Wish child was there.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1105/567056/spoilers-wwe-smackdown-and-main-event-taping-news-and-notes/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1105/567056/spoilers-wwe-smackdown-and-main-event-taping-news-and-notes/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN SPOIILERS</strong></p><p>By Jaimie Riggs on 2013-11-05 23:55:08</p><p>Alberto Del Rio called out John Cena for a match.

It was a very good show. I was only disappointed that a few guys were not there. Cena did a lot of work. He had an in-ring interview and two separate matches. There were "Yes" chants all night.</p><p>Best Pops The Uso's Daniel Bryan John Cena CM Punk</p><p>Most Boos Curtis Axel (wrestled Punk) Ryback (wrestled Cena) Alberto Del Rio</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/302994">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/302994</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
