                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2013-02-15 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-02-16 11:05:55+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, smackdown, ricardo_rodriguez, big_show, matt_striker, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THE ROCK IN LITTLE ROCK; THE BOOKER T MATCH MAKING FORMULA IN PLAY; ELIMINATION CHAMBER IS SUNDAY; IS ZEB COULTER LEADING JACK SWAGGER ON THE RIGHT PATH?; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-15 21:59:32</p><p>This Sunday is the Elimination Chamber and we finally know the six men who will have the opportunity to face the World Champion. What is next for the two men who will battle for the World Title? Will Miz try to get any revenge for what Antonio Cesaro did to him on Monday night? Will we hear from the participants in the main event of the Elimination Chamber? Remember that we FIGHT ON FRIDAY NIGHT!!!</p><p>We are in Little Rock, Arkansas and your announcers are Josh ‘Excelsior’ Mathews and John ‘Bubba’ Layfield.</p><p>We may fight on Friday nights, but we talk first.</p><p>Big Show makes his way to the ring and he is dressed to talk. We see what happened last week when Alberto Del Rio decided to go Earl Scheib on Big Show and the tour bus.</p><p>Show asks everyone if they thought that was funny. Show says that he hopes that them and Alberto Del Rio are happy because three innocent people suffered his wrath as a result of what happened last Friday. He wants to get straight to the point. Alberto Del Rio has never pinned him. Alberto does not have what it takes to pin him. Alberto Del Rio will never pin him. The rage that he has inside of him, he will unload on Alberto on the pay per view. He will put all of his rage into a ball and he will turn Alberto Del Rio’s fiesta into a siesta.</p><p>Chris Jericho’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Jericho reminds Show that he has known him for sixteen years and he knows what Show is feeling right now.</p><p>Show tells Chris that if he knows him that well, he should be as far away from him as possible. Show asks Chris if he should be on tour, writing a book, or hosting a giant robot show.</p><p>Chris says that he is back in the WWE and he is pumped to be here. He says that every Jerichoholic knows that is the case. Chris says that he can read Show like a book. Show might be angry and he might have some doubt. He knows how dangerous Big Show is because they have been tag champs before.</p><p>Chris says that he is a six time World Champion, he has main evented Wrestlemania, and he has been in the most Elimination Chamber Match. When he wins at the Elimination Chamber and when Big Show beats Alberto Del Rio, it will be him against Show at Wrestlemania. If that happens, he will become the new World Champion and it is a fact that Big Show can never eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeever forget agayne.</p><p>Show reminds Chris that they have been through a lot together. If Chris wins the Elimination Chamber and they face at Wrestlemania, it will be the last Wrestlemania appearance of Chris’ career. He tells Chris to get out of his face or he will hurt Chris so bad that he won’t make it to the pay per view.</p><p>Booker T’s music plays before Show can hit Jericho and he says that he sees where it is going and he likes it. We might not see Chris Jericho versus Big Show at Wrestlemania so we have an even number of people in the ring so we are going to have a match between Big Show and Chris Jericho.</p><p>Booker wants to know if we can dig it.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio is in the interview area with Matt Striker. Matt reminds Alberto of what Big Show mentioned about Show never pinning him. Alberto asks Ricardo if he is the World Champion and Ricardo says ‘si’. He asks Ricardo if he beat the Big Show twice and Ricardo says ‘si’. Alberto asks Ricardo if he made Show look like a big pumpkin last week and Ricardo says ‘si’. Alberto asks Ricardo if he is going to beat Big Show on Sunday and then go to Wrestlemania as the World Champion and Ricardo says ‘si’.</p><p>After the match, Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez appear on the stage and we have a stare down between the men in the World Title Match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75449/wwe-smackdown-report-the-rock-in-little-rock-the-booker-t-match-making-formula-in-play-elimination-chamber-is-sunday-is-zeb-coulter-leading-jack-swagger-on-the-right-path-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75449/wwe-smackdown-report-the-rock-in-little-rock-the-booker-t-match-making-formula-in-play-elimination-chamber-is-sunday-is-zeb-coulter-leading-jack-swagger-on-the-right-path-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
