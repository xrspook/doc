Unfortunately for them, most of those hits were to their faces as the self-proclaimed “super group” lost to The Miz, Alberto Del Rio & The Brooklyn Brawler at WWE’s TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs Sunday night.</p><p>The unscheduled match sprang to life after 3MB were announced as guests on “Miz TV.” When Heath Slater, Jinder Mahal and Drew McIntyre began to sing their own praises – figuratively speaking, thank goodness – they grew frustrated that no one took them seriously. They even went so far as to harass Carlos Cabrera and Marcelo Rodriguez when they thought WWE’s Spanish announcers were laughing at them. Alberto Del Rio’s personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, stepped up for his amigos, and his boss, The Mexican Aristocrat, soon followed. The band members then challenged Del Rio and Miz to find a partner so the men could settle their differences in the ring in a Six-Man Tag Team Match.</p><p>Later in the evening, Miz and Del Rio revealed their partner, much to the excitement of the crowd inside the Barclays Center: The Brooklyn Brawler. The hard-nosed Superstar emerged in a Brooklyn Nets basketball jersey and quickly found his share of action. He squared off against Slater and got in several hard knocks before Slater’s bandmates jumped in and punished Brawler. The action went back and forth until Miz nailed Mahal with a Skull-Crushing Finale. He then tagged in Brawler to finish the job. The Brooklyn native then locked the “Brooklyn Crab” onto Mahal and forced the 3MB member to tap out.</p><p>Next time, 3MB would do well to stick to butchering songs instead of trying to beat up on Superstars.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/events/wwe-tlc-tables-ladders-and-chairs/miz-del-rio-brawler-def-3mb-26077240">http://www.wwe.com/events/wwe-tlc-tables-ladders-and-chairs/miz-del-rio-brawler-def-3mb-26077240</a></p>
