                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2013-02-22 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-02-23 11:13:41+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, smackdown, ricardo_rodriguez, jack_swagger, wade_barrett, randy_orton, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: CHAMPION VERSUS CHAMPION; ORTON VERSUS SWAGGER; CODY FIGHTS A ONE ARMED MAN; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-22 21:59:34</p><p>The Road to Wrestlemania is a few days closer to its destination. Jack Swagger will be facing Alberto Del Rio for the World Title and he will be doing it for Americans. The Rock has a new title belt while we do not know who will have the chance to change the plates on the side of the belt.</p><p>This week, we are in Biloxi, Mississippi and your announcers are Josh’ They have casinos here too’ Mathews and John ‘Get your Bingo cards and drinking game rules ready’ Layfield.</p><p>Lillian Garcia introduces Ricardo Rodriguez and he introduces the man who has the longest current reigning major championship belt in WWE history, Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>In case you missed it, we have photos of Big Show tapping out to Alberto at the Elimination Chamber.</p><p>Del Rio says that at the Elimination Chamber, he retained his World Title. That means that they are going to Wrestlemania and they prove it by pointing to the sign. Alberto says that he found out who his opponent would be and that man is Jack Swagger. Alberto says that Jack has a new mission, a new friend, and a new attitude. Jack believes that he is everything that is right with America while Alberto is everything that is wrong with America.</p><p>Alberto says that he has heard Jack and saw what he had to say. Jack says that the problem in this country is with the immigrants who are taking jobs from people like Jack. This country was built by immigrants who were chasing the American dream. It was built by families looking for a better life. That is why America is so great.</p><p>The title is the result of his hard work and the American dream. Jack claims to be the ‘Real American’, Alberto thinks that he is the ‘Real Jackass’. Alberto tells Jack to come out so he can lay his hand out across Jack’s face.</p><p>Jack Swagger does not come out, but Randy Orton does make his way to the ring.</p><p>Randy has something to say and he tells Alberto that he is going to do his absolute best to stay calm, cool, and collected. Something was taken from him this past Sunday. He was this close to having the opportunity to regain the World Title against Alberto in the main event of Wrestlemania. It was taken by Jack Swagger.</p><p>Randy says that he respects Swagger because he would have done the same thing. Part of him wants to take out his rage on Jack Swagger tonight. Randy says that Alberto is wrestling Swagger at Wrestlemania. He wants Alberto to step aside tonight so he can take care of Swagger tonight.</p><p>Even though nobody has moved towards taking an offensive action in the ring, Booker T comes out and he says that this is not how he sees Smackdown going down. Booker has a few ideas. There will be a champion versus champion match. Alberto Del Rio will face Wade Barrett. Jack Swagger will be facing Randy Orton tonight.</p><p>Randy has his wish and Booker wants to know if someone wants to dig.</p><p>Jack Swagger is walking in the back and Zeb gives Jack a pep talk.</p><p>Wade Barrett says that he is not one to give out compliments, but he wants to say that it is about time that someone spoke the truth about what is going on in this country. He is looking forward to doling out some punishment on one of the main perpetrators.</p><p>Zeb tells Wade that there is an understanding. Wade doesn’t sound like him and he doesn’t sound like someone from around here. He asks Wade where he is from. Wade says that he is from England. Zeb tells Wade that he is part of the problem because he is stealing a job from an American. He suggests that Wade and Del Rio go out there and beat each other up so they can be sent back to where they come from in a two-for-one deal.</p><p>Jack tells Wade ‘We The People’ and Zeb tells Jack it is time to go.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: Wade Barrett versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</strong></p><p>Barrett works on the wrist but Del Rio rolls through and he kicks Barrett and sends him to the mat.
