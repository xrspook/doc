                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2012-12-28 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2012-12-29 11:45:24+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2012, smackdown, ricardo_rodriguez, big_show, sheamus, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: WINNING THE 'LOTTERY' PROVES DISASTROUS FOR TWO; THE SHIELD HAVE A NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE; TWIN MAGIC ADDS A Y CHROMOSOME</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-12-28 22:00:58</p><p>There have been fifty-one episodes of Smackdown in 2012, but will the final episode make an impact as we get ready for 2013 and the build to Royal Rumble. After Alberto Del Rio almost killed Santa on Monday night, what will he do to make up for that near disaster? Will the Shield show up? Make your resolution to watch tonight’s episode to find out.</p><p>Previously with the World Title. Big Show suffered the wrath of Sheamus. What will happen tonight after their match on Monday? Is the couple of the last few weeks of 2012 going to be the couple of 2013? What about their chaperone, Big E Langston? Will Dolph Ziggler uphold the honor of his (earmuffs) ‘crazy’ girlfriend against Miz?</p><p>This week, we are in Rochester, New York and your announcers are John ‘Did you know that Cal Ripken played in this town’ Layfield and Josh ‘If I had a dime for every time I heard a fact more than once on commentary, I would have as much money as my broadcast partner’ Mathews.</p><p>Sheamus makes his way to the ring and he is in a festive mood. Sheamus says that he hoped everyone had a Merry Christmas. Sheamus said he had a great time. It is a special time of year for him. He drank gallons of egg nog flavored ale. He says that he got a load of dodgy sweaters and ties that he will probably never wear. He got a year’s supply of sunscreen from his mom. The biggest present he got was a victory over Big Show in the Lumberjack Frost Match. Sheamus figures that this would be a good time to become the new World Champion because the New Year is so far away.</p><p>Sheamus tells Big Show to come to the ring. He wants to face Show for the World Title, in Rochester. If Show thinks the beating he faced on Monday was bad, wait until you see what he will do to Show tonight.</p><p>Big Show makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Show has a question for Sheamus and then he tells the crowd not to boo him. Show wants to know if he looks like Santa Claus to him.</p><p>The crowd chants ‘Yes’ and Sheamus agrees, but Show is way fatter.</p><p>Show chuckles and he says that is so cute. Maybe Sheamus should make a New Year’s Resolution and go into stand up comedy. That career will be as good as his chance to get another title match. Either Sheamus has amnesia or is in denial. He beat Sheamus on pay per view when it counted. Show says that he was on vacation mode on Monday. That match did not count. Sheamus comes up short when it counts.</p><p>That is why Sheamus will never tell him when and against whom he defends his title against.</p><p>Sheamus tells Show that he is a seven foot, five hundred pound coward who is afraid to fight him. Sheamus says that Show’s pride was on the line.</p><p>Show tells Sheamus that when it was important, he came up short.</p><p>Sheamus says that he pushed Show to the limit and he beat him. Sheamus says that he came here for a fight and the championship. Sheamus says that if he isn’t going to get a title shot, he is still going to get a fight.</p><p>Booker T’s music plays and he comes out and he is indignant. He tells Sheamus that Show is right. Show beat Sheamus at the TLC pay per view. Show tells the Ginger Snap to get to the back of the line. Booker reminds Show that Sheamus beat him on Monday.</p><p>Show says that he is done with Sheamus and Sheamus is not worthy at another chance at his World Title. Show says that there is not one single athlete in the locker room who is worthy of a title match. When he walks through the locker room, it reeks of inferiority. No one is worth his World Title.</p><p>Booker tells Show that he will be in action tonight.</p><p>Show wants to know who he will be facing.</p><p>Booker says that he has been working on a plan all week. Every Superstar will come out and their names will be placed in a tumbler, including Sheamus. Booker says that he will pick the person to face Big Show tonight.</p><p>Booker wants Teddy to bring out the Superstars.</p><p>Show complains about how Booker is playing with his championship. The collection of losers will not be for a title match. It will be a lottery to see who gets knocked out. Show promises to knock that person out.</p><p>The official Smackdown Tumbler comes out on the official tumbler holding table.</p><p>Eve and Teddy argue over who picks the man who will face Show. The tumbler falls on the floor. Teddy puts it back on the table and Booker makes the selection.</p><p>The winning bingo ball is Santino Marella.</p><p>Santino is in shock that he got picked and Show is laughing uncontrollably. Santino does the trombone dance and then he turns around and sees Big Show.</p><p>Santino wants to make sure that he was picked.</p><p>Show asks Santino if he wants a chance at the title and then he laughs and walks away.</p><p>Booker and Show are in the hallway. Show is broken up that Santino is unable to wrestle. Show says that he must have the night off. Booker says that there will be a World Title Match. Booker says that we will pick another opponent in the tumbler. Teddy the Tumbler Wrangler brings the Tumbler and Booker says that Show will find out soon who his opponent is and we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Show complains about needing to know so he can get ready for his opponent. Teddy brings Ricardo and Booker wants to know if Teddy told him. Show laughs even more than he did when he found out he was facing Santino.</p><p>Show asks Ricardo if he wants to be the World Champion. He puts the title belt on Ricardo’s shoulder and asks how it feels. Show wants Ricardo to announce himself as the new World Champion.</p><p>Ricardo starts to announce himself as champion but Show punches Ricardo and knocks him out.</p><p>Booker says that this is ridiculous. Show stares at Booker and walks away.<br></p><p>Josh mentions that Ricardo is now out as Big Show’s opponent for tonight.</p><p>Booker wants to know if Ricardo will be okay. The medical trainer says that he will be okay but Ricardo will not be able to wrestle.</p><p>Brad Maddox enters to check on Ricardo’s condition. Brad wants one more chance. Booker tells Brad to get out of his sight. Booker tells Brad it is not the right time. Brad demands one more chance and he asks Booker if he can dig that suckaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.</p><p>Booker tells Brad that he gets one more last chance. Booker tells Brad that his match is next.</p><p>Alberto enters the trainer’s room to check on Ricardo. Alberto tells Booker the moment he sees the Big Show, it will be like a giant piñata.</p><p>Booker tells Alberto that he will give him the title match against the Big Show.</p><p>Alberto tells Ricardo this one is for him and he gets ready for his match.</p><p>Big Show is in the interview area. Matt Striker asks Show about facing Alberto Del Rio. Show says that this is ridiculous. Booker feels that he has to appease the WWE Universe. Show mentions that he had two opponents already. One pulled a groin and the other got knocked out. Now he has to face Alberto Del Rio. Show says that everyone was a loser, a reject, a wannabe, or a nobody. He meant Alberto Del Rio. He will make it a trifecta if Alberto goes to the ring tonight.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p><strong>Match Number Seven: Big Show versus Alberto Del Rio for the World Heavyweight Title</strong></p><p>Del Rio with kicks and punches but Show with a head butt. Del Rio with more punches and kicks but Del Rio is sent to the mat. Show sets for the shhhh chop but Del Rio with punches and kicks. Show with a chop after the referee pulls Del Rio out of the corner. Show with a forearm to the back. Del Rio with head butts.</p><p>Show with a hip lock take down into a side head lock. Del Rio with a head scissors but Show escapes. Del Rio with kicks and punches but Show with a forearm to the back. Show chops Del Rio against the ropes. Del Rio with punches but Show pushes Del Rio to the floor. Show goes to the floor. Show Irish whips Del Rio into the ring steps.</p><p>They return to the ring and Show with an arm bar. Show with a shoulder tackle and then he walks across Del Rio’s chest. Show with a slam and then he tries for an elbow drop but Del Rio moves. Del Rio with a series of kicks to Show to keep Show off his feet. Del Rio with a super kick to the head but Show kicks out.</p><p>Del Rio gets back to his feet and he works on the arm to set up for the cross arm breaker. Del Rio with an arm bar and he tries to apply the hold but Show sends Del Rio to the floor. Show rolls out of the ring on the other side and he has had enough.</p><p>Show gets counted out by the referee.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio (by count out)</p><p>Sheamus attacks Show on the ramp but Show fights him off and Show walks to the back. The rest of the locker room comes out and they force Show back to the ring. The losers, nobodies, and wannabes send Show back into the ring. Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri and Sheamus with a Brogue Kick.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/74290/wwe-smackdown-report-winning-the-lottery-proves-disastrous-for-two-the-shield-have-a-new-years-message-twin-magic-adds-a-y-chromosome.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/74290/wwe-smackdown-report-winning-the-lottery-proves-disastrous-for-two-the-shield-have-a-new-years-message-twin-magic-adds-a-y-chromosome.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
