Since the crowd reaction was not good for the Albertoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, Ricardo speaks with a Southern accent before doing the proper introduction.</p><p>Alberto welcomes everyone and he says that we celebrate his victory over Dolph Ziggler at Payback and him regaining his World Title. We also celebrate that he is a four time World Champion. He says that not enough understand who Alberto Del Rio is, he wanted the closed captioning turned on so people can understand him because they are doing it his way.</p><p>Tonight, he is only going to speak Spanish.</p><p>The crowd chants USA.</p><p>Alberto says that he knew this was going to happen. It is good because this is not for the people, it is for himself. He is the champion. Alberto insults the fans as the USA chants get louder. He says that this is why Americans are ignorant.</p><p>Alberto says that it is enough pointing fingers because this is supposed to be fun. Alberto wants to start with the games and it is time to use the piñata. Alberto takes a swing at the piñata with Ziggler’s face on it and he breaks it.</p><p>Alberto says that he wants everyone to understand why he just did that. He busted the piñata like he bashed in Dolph Ziggler’s brains at Payback. He will do the same at Money in the Bank just to remain the World Champion.</p><p>Alberto says that Ziggler promised to ruin his party, but where is Dolph? If Ziggler has the cajones, why doesn’t he come out to face him. He wants to know what Ziggler is waiting for.</p><p>Ziggler’s music plays and the band leaves.</p><p>Ziggler stands on the stage and Del Rio draws a line in the ring for Ziggler to cross. Ziggler removes his watch and jacket and he makes his way to the ring at his own pace.</p><p>Ziggler takes Del Rio down and then Ricardo goes after Ziggler but Ziggler sends Ricardo over the top rope to the floor. Ziggler sees Ricardo on the turnbuckles and he press slams Ricardo through the table. Ziggler with a Zig Zag to Del Rio. Del Rio leaves the ring and then Ziggler sees Ricardo in the ring and Ziggler goes El Cabong to Ricardo.</p><p>Ziggler plays with the band and balloons fall from the rafters as we go to credits.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/78567/wwe-smackdown-report-world-title-money-in-the-bank-ladder-match-participants-announced-daniel-bryan-on-commentary-the-shield-in-action-kaitlyn-returns-fire-in-the-parody-battle-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/78567/wwe-smackdown-report-world-title-money-in-the-bank-ladder-match-participants-announced-daniel-bryan-on-commentary-the-shield-in-action-kaitlyn-returns-fire-in-the-parody-battle-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
