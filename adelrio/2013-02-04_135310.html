Stevie Flythe, lucky5nc and @hbzsrebel contributed to this report:</p><p>The main event was a World Heavyweight Title match between Alberto Del Rio and Big Show. It was decided via fan vote that it would be a No DQ match. Big Show came out to some loud boos. Del Rio got a good reaction, though it wasn't on the level of Orton or Sheamus. The No DQ stipulation didn't take long to come into play as both men used weapons. At this point, ECU turned into ECW as fans began chanting "we want (insert weapon here)" to which Del Rio and Big Show obliged. Chairs, tables, and kendo sticks all came out, which made for a pretty thrilling match. Del Rio played to the crowd very well, getting several "Si! Si! Si!" chants going. Finally, after Big Show set up a table and attempted to jump off the second rope onto Del Rio, the champ was able to give Big Show a bulldog through the table after Ricardo Rodriguez hit show with a microphone. This maneuver was enough to give him the win. Del Rio and Rodriguez then thanked the audience for coming and celebrated up the walkway.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0203/560095/wwe-live-event-results/index-2.shtml">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0203/560095/wwe-live-event-results/index-2.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE House Show Results 02.02.13 - Greenville, North Carolina</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 02.03.2013</p><p>Alberto Del Rio (w/Ricardo Rodriguez) defeated Big Show in a No Disqualification match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. This match was a straight up brawl. The fans voted for this over a Best of Three Falls Match. I'd say each man had his fair share of offense with neither of them dominating for too long. Del Rio came at Big Show with a kendo stick and a steel chair. Answering the fans chants, he pulled a table out from under the ring and set it up in the corner.</p><p>Big Show leaned Del Rio up against it and ran at him to put him through it, but Del Rio sidestepped him and Big Show put himself through it. Big Show propped Del Rio up on another table and was poised to dive and put him through it, but Ricardo distracted him and Del Rio recovered and Bulldogged him off the top rope and through the table for a pinfall victory.</p><p>Notes: Overall, the show was great. Minges Coliseum was pretty packed and the fans were hot all night. Both Vince and Linda McMahon graduated from East Carolina University, so it's surprising this is the first time they've had a show at the university in almost ten years. I hope they start coming more often after the impressive turnout this show had.</p><p>Biggest Pops Sheamus Randy Orton Alberto Del Rio</p><p>Most Heat Big Show Wade Barrett Cody Rhodes/Damien Sandow</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/272253">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/272253</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>2/2 SMACKDOWN RESULTS FROM GREENVILLE, NC</strong></p><p>By Craig Allen on 2013-02-03 12:31:52</p><p>Alberto Del Rio beat The Big Show in a No DQ match.
