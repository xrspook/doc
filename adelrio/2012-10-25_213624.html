                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2011-06-17 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2012-10-25 21:36:24+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2011, 战报, smackdown, big_show</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: THINGS ARE GETTING LESS CROWDED ON TOP; THE SIX DIVAS ON SMACKDOWN IN ACTION AGAIN; WE EVEN HAD RAW SUPERSTARS ON TONIGHT; AN ALL STAR RAW REMATCH</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-06-17 21:54:49</p><p>We start off with a look back to the night that Christian finally had enough of Randy Orton as the World Champion. Then we go to last week when Christian told his fans to stop cheering for him because they were the same fans who cost him the title five nights later against Randy Orton.</p><p>We are live on tape from Providence, Rhode Island and your announcers are Michael ‘There’s Something About Randy’ Cole, Josh ‘Home of the minor league affiliates of the Stanley Cup Champions’ Mathews, and Booker ‘Welcome to an Ivy League City’ T.</p><p>Josh Mathews is in the ring and he is joined by Raw Superstar Big Show.</p><p>Josh asks Show why is he on Smackdown tonight. Show says that he heard a rumor that Alberto Del Rio would be here. Josh reminds Show about his match with Del Rio on Sunday and we go to a video package that sets up the reason for the match on Sunday between Show and Del Rio.</p><p>Josh asks Show how he feels and Show says that he feels fine. Show takes a moment to collect his thoughts and he says that hitting him with the car . . .</p><p>Teddy Long comes out to interrupt Big Show and Teddy says that Show will not lay a hand on Alberto Del Rio if he shows up tonight. Earlier this morning, his office was informed that criminal and civil charges are being contemplated based on the attack on Ricardo Rodriguez. Teddy says that if any such action takes place tonight, Teddy will lose his job and so will Show. Since Show is ready to compete, he has chosen an opponent for Show. That person is Mark Henry.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio, that Raw superstar has forgotten what brand he is on because he has driven into the Dunkin Donuts Center.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio tells us who he is . . . but we already know that and so does the Big Show. He says that there are some rumors going around that he is negotiating his return to Smackdown because he is too afraid of the Big Show on Raw. Alberto says that he is not afraid of the Big Show. It is his destiny to be the next WWE Champion and no one can stop him, not even a giant. What happened with the Big Show, Ricardo Rodriguez, and his car was an accident. Accidents happen all the time. Alberto reminds us that he says that bad things happen to bad people.</p><p>Alberto shows us the footage of what happened on Monday night with Big Show and Ricardo Rodriguez.</p><p>Del Rio says that there are pending civil and criminal lawsuits against the Big Show. Ricardo was his best friend. He was loyal to him and he followed him just like a dog. What the Big Show did was wrong. Ricardo Rodriguez has a little baby girl named Consuela. His wife is a deacon in her church. Alberto says that Ricardo will get his revenge. Alberto says that he is going to dedicate his victory to his best friend Ricardo Rodriguez.</p><p>Alberto says that what the Big Show did was wrong because you don’t slaughter human beings in this ring. There is a reason why if the Big Show were standing in front of him, he would spit in Show’s face. Right after that . . .</p><p>We will have to wait to hear what is next and Big Show makes his way to the ring. Show goes into the ring but Alberto flees into the crowd. Show might not have gotten his hands on Alberto, he destroyed the bottom rope.</p><p>Show then takes his anger out on the announce table and the chairs at ringside. The ring bell and ring announcer pit is stripped down and destroyed by Show.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back with a Moments Ago Moment of Big Show forcing Alberto Del Rio out of the ring and into the crowd and Show’s destructive behavior.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/59052/wwe-smackdown-report-things-are-getting-less-crowded-on-top-the-six-divas-on-smackdown-in-action-again-we-even-had-raw-superstars-on-tonight-an-all-star-raw-rematch.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/59052/wwe-smackdown-report-things-are-getting-less-crowded-on-top-the-six-divas-on-smackdown-in-action-again-we-even-had-raw-superstars-on-tonight-an-all-star-raw-rematch.html?p=1</a></p>
