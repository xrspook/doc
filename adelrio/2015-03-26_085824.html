They will be taking on a team of ROH legends in “Mr ROH” Roderick Strong & The Briscoe Brothers!</p><p>Alberto El Patron has stated since he debuted in Ring of Honor that he wanted to face nothing but the best. He has faced and defeated Strong, ACH and Christopher Daniels in singles match ups. Now with the ever exciting Sydal & ACH by his side, they face three of the very best of not just today, but of ROH history. Sydal & ACH are gaining real traction as a team. Fans have clamored for more and more of the duo since they won Tag Wars 2014. They recognize this as another chance to take step up that ladder of success.</p><p>“Mr ROH” Roderick Strong is on fire right now. He has rededicated himself after leaving the Decade in late 2014. So far this year he has proven be the very best Roderick Strong yet and that makes him very dangerous. He does however have a loss against El Patron that he has a burning desire to avenge. This is his chance to do just that.</p><p>The Briscoes own nearly every tag team record in ROH and look for all opportunities to further strengthen their legacy. Teaming with Strong against a trio that features a legend and a tag team with a bright future is something the Briscoes see as a real challenge.</p><p>While Jay Briscoe is the currently ROH World Champion, it does need to be said that he is facing down his biggest challenge to date at Supercard of Honor IX in Samoa Joe. We all expect this to be a very physical, if not brutal contest and it create a few questions: Will Jay come out champion? Will Jay be physically ready after a war to take on an elite trio in El Patron, Sydal & ACH? Be there in San Antonio to see this special, potentially once in a lifetime match up. You will not be disappointed!</p><p>Be sure to check out Ring of Honor Television every Saturday morning on Fox 29 at 11:00am and every Sunday night at 9:30pm on CW35.
