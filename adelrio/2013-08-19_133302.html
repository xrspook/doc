Reports that Del Rio and Drew fought each other may be incorrect as the two may have gotten into a fight with other people outside of WWE.

Drew posted a photo of himself having dinner after SummerSlam and shows no signs of damage, as was reported.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0819/564990/update-on-reports-of-a-drew-vs-del-rio-fight/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0819/564990/update-on-reports-of-a-drew-vs-del-rio-fight/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio and Drew McIntyre Involved in Fight Over Weekend</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 08.19.2013</p><p>Alberto Del Rio was sporting a black eye for his match with Christian at SummerSlam on Sunday night.
