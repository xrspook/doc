We will be back next week for the Live Smackdown debut on Syfy.</p><p>We are live on tape from Bloomington, Illinois and your announcers are Todd ‘This won’t be MyNetwork anymore for Smackdown’ Grisham and Matt ‘Eureka . . . is on Syfy right now’ Striker.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio is in the garage area and he is standing over Christian. He says that he told him another time and another place. This is the time and the place. Officials come to get Del Rio out of there as the medical staff checks on Christian.</p><p>We are back with the Smack of the Night: Alberto Del Rio putting the Chihuahua down last month.</p><p>Ricardo Rodriguez is introduced so he could introduce Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>Alberto introduces himself and everyone knows that already. He says that Christian has been begging him for a match week after week. He told Christian that the match would take place when he is ready. Alberto says that he is ready but where is Christian. He says that Christian is crying in the parking garage. He says that all of his opponents end up in the hospital, just like Rey Mysterio. Alberto says that what he did to Rey was phenomenal and he wants to see it again.</p><p>We go to the video tape.</p><p>Alberto approves what he did to Rey. He tells everyone to take it easy because he has something for them. Alberto says that everyone is going to love him for this. He says that Rey Mysterio is coming back. He says that the Mexican Idol is coming back to Smackdown next week. Alberto tells everyone not to get too excited because he is not going to be here too long. He says that Rey challenged him to a match. Alberto says that he doesn’t want to fight him. He says that he will give him a kiss right on the cheek.</p><p>Christian’s music plays and he comes to the ring holding his shoulder showing the effect of the earlier attack.</p><p>Christian punches Alberto but Ricardo grabs Christian by the foot and that allows Del Rio to connect with a kick. Del Rio puts Christian in the cross arm breaker and Christian finally gets out of the hold and he goes to the floor. Alberto gets a chair and he puts Christian’s arm in the chair and he sends Christian into the ring post.</p><p>The medical staff checks on Christian while Alberto gloats over his performance.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=51204&p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=51204&p=1</a></p>
