What is next for John Cena and Dolph Ziggler? What will Ryback do to CM Punk this week after being kept out of the Punkiversary by Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, and Roman Reigns. What will these three men say when they get to talk to Michael Cole?</p><p>This week’s Raw comes from Lafayette, Louisiana and your announcers are Michael ‘Cajun’ Cole and Jerry ‘Gumbo’ Lawler.</p><p>Michael Cole says that Rosa Mendes is livid over what Hornswoggle did to her with the flowers.</p><p>Rosa is shown yelling at Hornswoggle. Hornswoggle says that it was a joke. Who would want to kiss her and give her flowers. Rosa says that everyone wants to kiss her.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio tells Rosa not to let this little piece of trash deal with her because no woman will deal with him. Alberto tells Rosa he will take care of Hornswoggle.</p><p>Great Khali comes up from behind and tells Alberto to leave his friend alone.</p><p><strong>Match Number Two: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Great Khali (with Hornswoggle)</strong></p><p>The match is joined in progress and Khali with a chop to the chest and Del Rio collapses into the ropes in pain. Rosa watches from the back while Khali gets ready to chop Del Rio again. Khali with a chop to the back of the neck and Del Rio goes down. Del Rio with kicks to the leg and a drop kick to the knee.</p><p>Del Rio with a kick and then he starts to work on the arm. Del Rio with an arm bar. Del Rio with a kick to the back of the head for a near fall. Del Rio wraps Khali’s arm in the ropes to add more pressure.</p><p>Del Rio with the step up enzuigiri into the shoulder. Del Rio tries for another charge into the corner but Khali with an elbow followed by a boot and a few clotheslines. Khali with a chop to the top of the head. Ricardo gets on the apron and Hornswoggle gets fed with some of Ricardo’s rear end.</p><p>Del Rio with a single arm breaker and then he applies the cross arm breaker and Khali taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, we see Rosa excited over Del Rio’s win.</p><p>Alberto and Ricardo are walking in the back and Rosa stops Alberto and she thanks Alberto for defending her honor. Alberto tells her whatever she needs.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/73599/live-ongoing-wwe-raw-report-ryback-wants-to-be-fed-what-will-the-three-from-nxt-say-forget-ajcena-what-about-del-riorosa-why-does-vickie-hate-cm-punk-so-much.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/73599/live-ongoing-wwe-raw-report-ryback-wants-to-be-fed-what-will-the-three-from-nxt-say-forget-ajcena-what-about-del-riorosa-why-does-vickie-hate-cm-punk-so-much.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
