Who will get immunity and will it be necessary to save their spot on the show? We start off with some highlights from the first few weeks of this season of NXT.</p><p>We are live on tape on the internet and your announcers are Josh ‘Happy Anniversary to the Greatest Night in Wrestling History’ Mathews and Todd ‘Who gets to go to Carousel tonight’ Grisham. Your host is Matt ‘Remember to vote in the PWInsider.com Year End Polls because they wait until the end of the year’ Striker.</p><p>We are back and it is time for Matt Striker to tell us which of the five rookies who do not have immunity will be eliminated.</p><p>Matt asks Johnny who should go home and Johnny says that the big bag of stink should go home. He asks Brodus how his jaw is.</p><p>We go to the random WWE NXT’limination Generator. The unlucky rookie is Jacob Novak.</p><p>Matt asks Jacob for his final thoughts. Jacob says that it is a crushing blow. This was an opportunity for him to change his own life. He says that he always wanted to stand in front of the WWE Universe because they share the same passion. He says that it has been the experience of his life.</p><p>Matt tells us that the next elimination will take place in two weeks.</p><p>Dolph tells Masters that his rookie is gone and Dolph says that he is a genius. Masters tries to give Ziggler a Master Lock and Dolph goes to the back.</p><p>Johnny wants to go after Brodus again but Derrick Bateman holds him back.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=54064">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=54064</a></p>
