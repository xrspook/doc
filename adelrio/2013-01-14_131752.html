Mize for sending these additional details for last night's SmackDown live event in Tyler, TX:</p><p>75% attendance in a 6,000 capacity arena. WWE security was as tight as it has ever been. I had a student from my school with me. We wrote WWE about letting him meet the wrestlers and Oil Palace personnel were OK with it, but WWE would not allow this by any means. Really was disappointed about that. The wrestlers have usually been very cordial about meeting the kids for autographs and pictures in the past.</p><p>The biggest flop of the night was the main event. I may not be liked for saying this, but what is Vince McMahon thinking by putting the title on Alberto Del Rio? Del Rio is good, but he is not worthy to have that strap around his waist. Big Show came out and ran Tyler down. He said he was only here to get his belt back. I have seen him many times before, but still marvel at his size and strength. He did some good things, but Del Rio hit him with an insaguri to the back of the head and got a good clean 3 count. I was surprised that Big Show would sell it. Del Rio went up to the ramp and showed the crowd the belt and then left. He did not go around shaking hands. Big Show left as well, glaring at the crowd. Afterwards, security was tight and ran several fans off from trying to see the wrestlers. This was by far the most unfriendly wrestling event that I have attended (I have been to probably hundreds of shows).</p><p>I don't want to be negative towards the future of wrestling, but we have two champs who would not break cruiserweight in the old WCW. CM Punk stirs people up on the mic and he can wrestle, but Del Rio is just not believable to me. He is a cartoonish gimmick.</p><p>I was watching the NWO video WWE just recently put out... Ted Dibiase said it best. When people go to the movies, they want to see the unexpected. When people watch a soap opera they want the unexpected... the same goes for wrestling. I don't think wrestling will ever get as hot as it was in the late 90's until Vince does the unexpected. Right now wrestling is bland. I hope WWE will spice it up again. On another note about Del Rio... if you want creative to keep the belt on you, then I would probably try to become a champion for the people. Shaking hands and acknowledging the fans would help your cause. I would also like to say to the WWE in general. The fans are the reason you are in business. I hope you will recognize that!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0114/559487/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0114/559487/</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
