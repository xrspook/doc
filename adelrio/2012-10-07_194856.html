The whole top section was empty, but the rest of the arena was pretty full. This was my first house show since they added a stage. I like it. It makes it seem more like a TV taping.</p><p>Sheamus defeated Alberto Del Rio in a Last Man Standing match. Del Rio came out with Ricardo and they were ripping up Sheamus signs in the crowd. Ricardo put a Del Rio shirt on Tony Chimel and was throwing a poster board at him which I found hilarious. Del Rio cut a promo about Orange County Mexicans not being real Mexicans and said things in Spanish that the hispanic crowd booed. Sheamus cut some cheesy promo about Alberto being a "coward" and he was going to "kick his arse." Good match that went to the stage and into the crowd. Ricardo was holding Sheamus in the corner when Del Rio came at him with a chair. Sheamus ducked and Ricardo took a chair shot. Sheamus hit the Brogue Kick and Del Rio was out for the 10 count to end the match.</p><p>Dolph Ziggler's music hit and he came out with the briefcase and a referee. He handed the ref the briefcase. When he turned around, he got hit with a Brogue Kick. Sheamus played to the crowd and took a picture with a red headed kid. As much as I hate the Sheamus character, he seemed pretty nice and the kids loved him.</p><p>Notes: Overall, a fun show. I paid 30 bucks for floor seats on Stubhub which were 90 face value. I was worried because Smackdown isn't as entertaining as Raw and I haven't been to a house show in a few years, but I had a great time and got my money's worth. Honda Center is a pretty good venue if you are in So Cal.</p><p>Biggest Pops Sheamus Rey Mysterio Ryback</p><p>Most Heat Alberto Del Rio Rhodes/Miz Primetime Players</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/257895">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/257895</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>10/6 WWE results Anaheim, Calif.: Sheamus vs. Del Rio LMS main event, MITB cash-in tease, Ryback in Lumberjack match</strong></p><p>Oct 7, 2012 - 12:55:24 AM</p><p>WWE Smackdown house show results</p><p>October 6, 2012 Anaheim, Calif.</p><p>Report by Matt Massingham, PWTorch West Coast correspondent</p><p>(7) World Hvt. champion Sheamus beat Alberto Del Rio in a Last Man Standing match to retain the World Title. Del Rio could not answer the 10-count to take a loss.</p><p>After the match, Dolph Ziggler ran in and looked to cash in MITb, but he ate the Brogue Kick from Sheamus, so no cash-in took place.</p><p>The show was decent, overall, but the show was missing Ziggler in a match. The stars most over with the crowd were Rey, Ryback, and Sheamus.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_65764.shtml">http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article_65764.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown Live Event Results From Anaheim (10/6) - Dolph Ziggler Attempts To Cash In, Ryback</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri October 08, 2012</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Nick C. for sending in these results from Saturday's live event in Anaheim, CA:</p><p>Del Rio cut a promo on the Jumbotron proclaiming he will beat Sheamus for the World Hvt. Title tonight.</p><p>Ricardo Rodriguez introduced Alberto Del Rio to the ring and, as he came out, he attempted to tear up a fan's sign of Sheamus. This brought out Sheamus to a big pop.</p><p>World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus defeated Alberto Del Rio in a "Last Man Standing Match" when Del Rio couldn't answer the 10 count after Sheamus hit him with the Brogue Kick. After the match, Dolph Ziggler attempted to cash in his MITB but was unsuccessful when Sheamus gave him a Brogue Kick.</p><p>Solid show and the Honda Center was more than half full. All 3 advertised matches happened. Only disappointment was that Ziggler didn't wrestle, but at least he showed up and attempted to cash in the briefcase. Obviously Orton wasn't advertised, since he is filming the 12 Rounds sequel.</p><p>Biggest Pops: Sheamus Rey and Sin Cara Ryback Ziggler (some pops) Barrett (some pops)</p><p>Biggest Heat: Del Rio Cody and Miz Mahal Slater Ziggler (some heat)</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1008/556971/dolph-ziggler/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1008/556971/dolph-ziggler/</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
