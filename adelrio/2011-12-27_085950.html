                            <h1>WWE 2011年TOP 25比赛</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2011-12-27 08:59:50+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点图片</p><p>标签: wwe, raw, ppv, 2011, royal_rumble, tlc, extreme_rules, alberto_del_rio, the_miz, cm_punk, rey_mysterio, christian</p><hr><p># 22: WWE Championship Triple Threat TLC Match from WWE TLCThrough blistering battles with John Cena and captivating interviews, CM Punk earned his spot as the biggest Superstar of 2011. At WWE TLC, The Straight Edge Superstar proved he deserved it. Defending his WWE Championship against The Miz and Alberto Del Rio in a dangerous Triple Threat TLC Match, The Second City Saint overcame the underhanded tactics of his rivals — including the interference of Ricardo Rodriguez and being handcuffed to the turnbuckle by The Awesome One — and scaled the ladder to grab the his title. Soon after, Punk tweeted, “My march to WrestleMania doesn't begin after the Rumble. It starts today. You're in or you're out. If you're out, you'll be left behind.” So, in or out?</p><p># 17: WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Rey Mysterio from RawBitter rivals since the day Alberto Del Rio rolled into WWE in a custom car, The Mexican Aristocrat and The Master of the 619 thrill WWE fans every time they lock up, so it was no surprise that their August 15 showdown on Raw grabbed our attention. Three weeks after winning and losing the WWE Championship in a single night, Rey Mysterio wanted nothing more than to reclaim the illustrious prize in the heart of the San Diego. He came close to doing just that after nailing Del Rio in the face with his iconic 619, but the underhanded champion managed to counter a diving splash to beat his rival. After the bell, The Mexican Aristocrat ruthlessly applied his tendon-snapping cross armbreaker to Rey, proving he’s as devious as it gets.</p><p># 07: The 40-Man Royal Rumble MatchA WWE tradition since 1988, the over-the-top Royal Rumble has long been one of sports-entertainment’s true proving grounds, but it was never as big as it was in 2011. Cramming 40 Superstars into one ring over the course of an hour, this record-setting battle royal played host to the surprising returns of Booker T and Kevin Nash, a strength-in-numbers display from New Nexus and a bizarre partnership between John Cena and Hornswoggle. But, in the end, it was the slimy Alberto Del Rio who survived the grueling bout, dumping Santino Marella to earn a first class ticket to WrestleMania. Some guys have all the luck.</p><p># 06: Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio from Extreme RulesAlberto Del Rio claimed it was his destiny to obtain the vacant World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules. For Christian, it was simply a way to honor his friend Edge, whose injuries in defending the title forced him into early retirement. In May, The Mexican Aristocrat and Captain Charisma met in a Ladder Match with the coveted Championship hanging above their heads. Throughout much of the bout, Del Rio seemed to have his opponent on the ropes after threading Christian’s arm through the ladder and applying the Cross Armbreaker. But the arrival of Edge offered just enough of a distraction to turn the tide. With his opponent preoccupied, Captain Charisma toppled The Essence of Excellence out of the ring and climbed rung by rung to take the title as his best friend watched with tears in his eyes. It was almost like destiny.</p><p>Top 25:Matches of 2011The year's best boutsWhat makes a great match? Action? Athleticism? Suspense? The subjective quality of a bout always make that hard to pin down, but that didn't stop WWE.com from ranking the 25 bouts that exemplify the excitement, drama and glory that made 2011 great.</p>
