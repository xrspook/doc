The Viper claimed that Del Rio was not only “dishonest,” but also had picked the wrong Superstar to make an example of. The nine-time World Champion promised to give his adversary the “most brutal beating of his life” at Hell in a Cell. (MATCH PREVIEW)</p><p>The Mexican Aristocrat interrupted, characterizing his pay-per-view opponent, not as a Viper, but as a “garden snake that he could crush with his boot whenever he wanted.” He also insisted that he was the “the new Apex Predator of WWE.”</p><p>While Orton insinuated that Del Rio was afraid of him, the affluent competitor chose not to get in the ring with his adversary two days before their Hell in a Cell clash. However, as the furious Viper watched him go, Wade Barrett suddenly launched a sneak attack, taking down Orton form behind.</p><p>Moments later in the back, Barrett asked Del Rio if that was what he was looking for, indicating that he had attacked Orton at The Mexican Aristocrat’s direction. Teddy Long, the Senior Adviser to the SmackDown General Manager, then informed the English Superstar that Booker T had called him to go one-on-one with The Viper later on SmackDown.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-10-26/results-26062092">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-10-26/results-26062092</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Sheamus and Big Show brought the anarchy before the ‘Hell’</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>October 26, 2012</p><p><strong>Wade Barrett def. Randy Orton</strong></p><p></p><p>Following a sneak attack by Wade Barrett earlier in the show, Randy Orton took on The Barrett Barrage in a fierce back-and-forth battle that stretched both inside and outside the ring. But thanks to a key distraction from Orton’s Hell in a Cell opponent, Alberto Del Rio, in the climactic final moments of the match, Barrett unleashed the Souvenir Elbow on The Viper from behind for the victory.</p><p>As the smoke cleared, Del Rio looked to once again prove himself the “new WWE Apex Predator” by attacking his fallen Hell in a Cell opponent. But when he tried for the Cross Armbreaker, Orton countered, nearly hitting the RKO before Del Rio escaped out of the ring.</p><p>The exchange served as one more example of the personal nature of the coming fight between Orton and Del Rio at Hell in a Cell and served as a definitive warning that the WWE Universe had better brace themselves for an all-out war this Sunday.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-10-26/results-26062092/page-4">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-10-26/results-26062092/page-4</a></p>
