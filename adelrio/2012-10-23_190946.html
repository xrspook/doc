Del Rio covered him for the win.</p><p>Your winner and new WWE champion, Alberto Del Rio!</p><p>Cena hit the ring as soon as the match ended and the Cell was raised but R Truth and Miz attacked everyone with pipes. The Cell was lowered as Triple H and other officials hit the scene. Miz and Truth beat down everyone in the cage, including the referees and the camera men as the entire WWE locker room ran out, faces and heels alike, trying to get in. A swarm of police ran out. They finally cut the lock with bolt cutters. The cops ran in and Miz and Truth immediately dropped to their knees and allowed themselves to be handcuffed. Other police held back all the wrestlers. Miz and Truth were walked through the wrestlers. Triple H lost it and attacked them both. Johnny Ace tried to stop him and was nailed by HHH. HHH was dragged off and the announcers wondered if he was being arrested as well. They went off the air at this point.</p><p>The Cell match was your typical Triple Threat match although it was a lot more brutal with all the stiff chair and Cell shots. The angle at the end was a great chaotic ending to the PPV that put a TON of heat on Miz and Truth as outsiders and also left the question hanging as to the future of HHH as the COO. An effective cliffhanger angle.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=62152&p=3">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=62152&p=3</a></p>
