Also, email me at jw_bball_615@hotmail.com - I am ALWAYS taking feedback for my weekly "random thoughts" column every Wednesday. Outside of the VERY interesting Raw television rating that just came out, my book is open. As for today, let's get to it. Thanks to Carl for the topic!</p><p>A Twitter user asked me about Alberto Del Rio going through the mid-card.</p><p>Right off the bat, it was a good thought. Thus, I decided to dive right into a little mini-column for Tuesday. That is all I ask for from my readers - a worthwhile topic sent to me in a respectful manner. No cussing. No swearing or foul language. Just a simple idea! That's it.</p><p>As for Del Rio, I have spoken on him before.</p><p>He is not "boring."</p><p>He is not "amazing."</p><p>He is somewhere in between right now. The man is just a good (or even great some nights) heel character that has a lot of wrestling ability. As WWE explores the hispanic market, he needs to be protected in a lot of areas. He may lose quite often, but his "spot" is never going to be too far off from the main event scene.</p><p>He was given some much in 2011 (and in 2010) that it will be tough to fully live up to that again in his career. When reports come out about "now or never" talent, one of the main names is Alberto Del Rio. WWE is not going to have him on the roster much longer. Thus, he HAS to get a ton of attention each week. Whether he deserves it or not is up for discussion.</p><p>Right now, he is in a feud with Sheamus for the World Title. It is nothing flashy, excellent, or out of this world spectacular. However, their feud was entertaining and worth the effort put into it for the past few months. As with all things, it is time to move on. Sheamus and Del Rio have nothing left to do inside the ring.</p><p>That begs the question noted above:</p><p>What's next for Alberto Del Rio?</p><p>Well, I don't think he will "officially" move to the middle of the card. That is not really an option right now. If it was done for a little bit, it certainly wouldn't hurt. The man just needs to be built back up and seem like a major player again (like in 2011). As he moves away from the World Title scene, Del Rio will be in a unique situation.</p><p>It won't be the mid-card.</p><p>It will be like the UPPER mid-card.</p><p>Think of guys like Kane. Or Big Show. Or Rey Mysterio. Or The Miz right now. They are not in the "dead end" mid-card that does nothing. They are men that could move up and down the card at the drop of a hat.</p><p>If WWE needs a heel opponent for Randy Orton one month, give him Del Rio.</p><p>If WWE needs a heel World Title challenger for Sheamus, give him Del Rio.</p><p>If WWE needs somebody to interact with a male celebrity one night, give him Del Rio.</p><p>That will be his role moving forward. He will almost be like a "flex player" for WWE. When WWE needs a spot filled, he will fit. From the mid-card to the main event scene, Del Rio is fine in any area. Like I mentioned above, every company has a couple of guys just like that. They are never in one "set spot" - just kind of move around the show at all times. If he catches fire, the main event will be wating for him. If he loses steam, then so be it...</p><p>Up and down the card he will go. Where will he end up? Nobody knows! </p></blockquote><p>转载自：<a href="http://nodq.com/columns/347593982.shtml">http://nodq.com/columns/347593982.shtml</a></p>
