He yelled at Ricardo to get his food. Miz showed up and said they worked together to weaken Punk but when the bell rings...Alberto cut him off and said that there was never any alliance. He said he was just using Miz. Miz said "Really?" several times. He said that Del Rio's title run was as unineresting as the Ravens' Superbowl reign. Miz bragged that he beat John Cena at Wrestlemania while Del Rio couldn't beat Edge while Edge's neck was hanging on by a thread. Del Rio started mocking Miz in Spanish and Miz told him he didn't comprende, mocking Alberto. Alberto said he was a real man while Miz was a pretend badass from a reality show. He said that Miz couldn't take Ricardo, much less Alberto. Ricardo came back with food and Miz shoved it in his face. Ricardo stood there shocked and Del Rio shoved him down as well. Good segment.<br><br>*********************************************************************</p><p><br><br>WWE champion CM Punk vs. The Miz vs. Alberto Del Rio - TLC Match<br><br>Big CM Punk chant when he hit the ring.

Miz missed a shot towards the ringpost and hurt his hand, dropping the chair. Punk beat the hell out of his back with the chair on the floor. Punk sat Miz on the top of the ring barrier and placed a chair in front of him. He charged and leapt off the chair, nailing the kneelift in the corner. Miz fell into the first row.<br><br>With everyone down, Punk pulled a ladder into the ring. He climbed to the top but Ricardo handcuffed Punk to the ladder. That allowed Del Rio to kick the hell out Punk. Alberto began climbing the ladder but Punk kicked the strut he was cuffed to, then kicked the other strut, destroying the ladder.

Punk went for a superplex off the top through a table to the floor but Alberto returned to the ring and drilled Punk with a hard enziguiri to the head and Punk fell backwards off the ropes through the table on the floor. The crowd chanted, "Holy sh**."<br><br>On the outside, Del Rio drlled Miz with a ladder, then with a chair. The crowd began chanting for Punk. Del Rio locked Miz's arm inside a ladder, then locked on the cross armbreaker. Miz screamed in pain. Ricardo started screaming in Spanish for Alberto to forget Miz and return to the ring. Del Rio slammed a chair down onto the out of it Punk, then beat another chair over the champion several times. He locked Punk's arm in a chair and locked in the cross armbreaker on Punk.<br><br>Del Rio set up the ladder in the center of the ring and began climbing. Miz and Punk were able to return and tipped the ladder. Del Rio flew off and was crotched on top, then crashed to the outside. Punk and Miz, both hurting, battled back and forth with right hands. They clotheslined each other. Ricardo set up a ladder in the center and climbed to the top as the announcers questioned what he was doing. He got to the top but Miz and Punk tipped the ladder over and Ricardo took this insane bump off the top of the ladder down through two tables set up at ringside. He sailed past the one closest to the ring and crashed through the other one. Referees began checking him immediately as it was a scary as hell bump.<br><br>Punk and Miz began battling back and forth in the ring. Punk missed a charge in the corner and nailed his shoulder in the ringpost. Miz grabbed the open handcuff and locked it on Punk agaun, this time to the outside of the turnbuckle that connects to the ringpost. Miz started mocking him, so Punk nailed a roundhouse kick to the head, KOing him. Punk began trying to unhook the turnbuckle as Aberto and Miz began setting up ladders, trying to get to the belt. The building began chanting for Punk. As Alberto and Miz made it to the top of the ladder, Punk snapped the turnbuckle free from the ring and attacked Miz from behind with a series of shots . All three battled on top of the ladders. Miz was knocked to the floor. He and Del Rio battled on top and Del Rio was punched off.<br><br>Punk nearly had the belt but Miz pulled him down. Miz scrambled up but Punk pulled him onto his shoulders and nailed the GTS. Punk climbed to the top and grabbed the belt.<br><br>Your winner and still WWE champion, CM Punk!<br><br>Punk sat on the top of the ladder holding the belt to close the show. He held the belt up and screamed, "Best in the world!"<br><br>A hell of a hard hitting main event to close the show. This was a really physical war and while the handcuff stuff could have been really campy, it worked really well as a false finish because the crowd was so into Punk as a top guy. There were some really great bumps and all three, as well as Ricardo, have to be applauded for this performance. A hell of a way to end the WWE PPV calendar. Loved this.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://kuai.xunlei.com/d/SEAWBXLCMPXI">http://kuai.xunlei.com/d/SEAWBXLCMPXI</a><br></p>
