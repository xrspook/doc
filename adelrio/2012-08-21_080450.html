Wow, that sure rates doesn't it? ... In case I didn't mention this early, and maybe I didn't due to the fact that my mind was blurred with the stupidity of the booking, it wouldn't shock me to see Sheamus win and have Ziggler cash in MITB to prove to all of us that Dolph is a loser that can't win a fair fight.</p><p>They are starting off hour two of the show with The World Title match. Wow, that sure rates doesn't it? ... In case I didn't mention this early, and maybe I didn't due to the fact that my mind was blurred with the stupidity of the booking, it wouldn't shock me to see Sheamus win and have Ziggler cash in MITB to prove to all of us that Dolph is a loser that can't win a fair fight. ... ADR is in control early, dominating the action. He has gotten near falls and is working hard. Sheamus is selling well too. ... Alberto slapped on the arm breaker and Sheamus did a great power spot to break it up. It got a lot of people in the crowd chanting for him. Sheamus got a two with White Noise. He set up for the Brogue Kick but ADR back up so he speared him and pounded his chest. Alberto came back with a kick to the head for a two. ... For some reason, ADR attacked Ricardo. Bad move. They did the botched spot with Ricardo and Sheamus used the shoe to get the pin. Alberto got the pin, even though ADR's foot was on the rope. So, the face champ used the heel's gimmick AND pulled the heel's foot off the rope. Draw your own conclusions. ... The match itself was very good. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=71251&p=2">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=71251&p=2</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411’s WWE SummerSlam Report: 08.19.12</strong></p><p>Posted by Scott Slimmer on 08.19.2012</p><p>We are LIVE in beautiful Los Angeles, California.</p><p>World Heavyweight Championship Match</p><p>Sheamus (Champion) vs. Alberto Del Rio w/ Ricardo Rodriguez</p><p>Sheamus muscles Del Rio to the ropes, but Del Rio swing him around and traps him in the corner. The action spills to the outside, and Sheamus and Del Rio beat each other all around ringside. Del Rio eventually rolls Sheamus back into the ring, but Sheamus traps Del Rio in the corner and works him over with a volley of punches.

Sheamus goes for the Celtic Cross, but he's too close to the corner and Del Rio escapes to the top turnbuckle. Sheamus tries to pull Del Rio back to the middle of the ring, but Del Rio exposes the top turnbuckle in the process. Sheamus goes for the Brogue Kick, but Del Rio ducks and kicks Sheamus out of the ring. Del Rio heads to the outside and whips Sheamus shoulder-first into the ring steps. Del Rio rolls Sheamus back into the ring and locks in a rear chin lock, but Sheamus tries to counter into a neck breaker, but Del Rio counters and kicks Sheamus in the back of the leg.

Del Rio rolls up Sheamus, but Sheamus kicks out at two. Rodriguez scampers into the ring and tosses his shoe to Del Rio, but Sheamus catches the shoe and nails Del Rio with it as the referee has his back turned and his attention focuses on Rodriguez. Sheamus hits Del Rio with the Irish Curse Backbreaker and gets the three count even though Del Rio definitely had his foot on the ropes. After the three count, Sheamus knocks Del Rio's foot off the ropes so that the referee never saw it was there. Not sure if that was a botched ending or not.</p><p>Match Result: Sheamus defeats Alberto Del Rio with the Irish Curse Backbreaker.
