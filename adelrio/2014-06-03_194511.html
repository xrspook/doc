                            <h1>WWE PPV MITB 2014 官方对阵</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2014-06-03 19:45:11+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2014, ppv, mitb, 官方, 对阵</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>Money in the Bank Ladder Match</strong></p><p>BY Alex Giannini</p><p>June 02, 2014</p><p></p><p>At WWE Payback, an as-yet-undetermined number of competitors will vie for the opportunity to challenge for Daniel Bryan’s illustrious WWE World Heavyweight Championship. And they’ll do it in one of the most brutal and unpredictable match stipulations in history — a Money in the Bank Ladder Match. But there’s one more catch. If Daniel Bryan is medically unable to compete at Money in the Bank, this unique Ladder Match will turn into a championship bout for the first time ever.</p><p>As ordered by Stephanie McMahon on the June 2 edition of Raw, if Bryan is able to compete, he will face Kane in a Stretcher Match with the title on the line. If not, the title will officially be vacated, and will be up for grabs in the Money in the Bank Ladder Match.</p><p>Later that night, Alberto Del Rio officially became the first entrant into the Ladder Match, as Mexico’s Greatest Export downed Dolph Ziggler in a back and forth one-on-one battle.</p><p>Who else will be part of this potentially historic bout at WWE Money in the Bank? And will the match determine the new No. 1 contender to Bryan’s crown … or will the WWE World Heavyweight Title itself hang in the balance?</p><p>Tune in to WWE Money in the Bank live on WWE Network and pay-per-view on Sunday, June 29, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/2014/money-in-the-bank-ladder-match-26363507">http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/2014/money-in-the-bank-ladder-match-26363507</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE World Heavyweight Championship Ladder Match</strong></p><p>BY Alex Giannini</p><p>June 16, 2014</p><p></p><p>The lineup is now complete, and at WWE Money in the Bank, Roman Reigns, John Cena, Randy Orton, Bray Wyatt, United States Champion Sheamus, Cesaro and Alberto Del Rio will compete in a Ladder Match to decide the next WWE World Heavyweight Champion.</p><p>Previous champion Daniel Bryan was stripped of the title on Raw June 9 after it was revealed he would not be medically cleared to compete. Though the decision to vacate the title represented a brutally bitter loss for the popular “Yes!” Man, it also created a huge opportunity for the Superstars who will be vying for WWE’s most prestigious prize on June 29.</p><p>While The Viper, Randy Orton, was placed into the contest by The Authority, the remaining six competitors all won qualifying matches to earn their coveted spots. The two latest Superstars to qualify, Reigns and Cena, qualified by winning a Battle Royal and defeating Kane in a Stretcher Match, respectively, on the June 16 edition of Raw.</p><p>The finalized field of seven is among the most stacked match lineups in WWE history. Collectively, Cena, Del Rio, Sheamus and Orton boast a remarkable 33 World Championship reigns. None of the three other competitors has ever won a World Title, but Reigns, Wyatt and Cesaro are surely looking to establish themselves as WWE’s premier warrior.</p><p>The wielder of the Superman Punch appears intent on getting back at Orton and Triple H for their part in breaking up The Shield, and the sinister sermonizer, Wyatt, seems newly interested in possessing the one accolade that equates to complete power in WWE. Not to be forgotten is The King of Swing, a former U.S. Champion who, backed up by renowned advocate Paul Heyman, just may have the strength, strategy and surgical ring skill to capture the crown.</p><p>What will happen when seven of the toughest and most decorated Superstars collide with the WWE World Heavyweight Championship literally hanging in the balance? And what kind of brutality is in store for June 29, when steel ladders are not only completely legal, but the only means of capturing the most important championship in the world?</p><p>Find out when history is made and a new WWE World Heavyweight Champions is named at Money in the Bank! Available on WWE Network and on pay-per-view, the huge event takes place Sunday, June 29, at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/2014/wwe-world-heavyweight-championship-ladder-match-26363507">http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/2014/wwe-world-heavyweight-championship-ladder-match-26363507</a></p><p></p><p>Who will be the next champion?</p><p>Now that the final entrants for June 29's WWE World Heavyweight Championship Ladder Match have been decided, one question remains: Which Superstar will leave Money in the Bank with WWE's most prestigious prize?</p><p></p>
