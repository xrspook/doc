BUT THE OLD ONE IS BACK SO NEVER MIND; VINCE GIVES CENA AN ULTIMATUM; MIZ AND RILEY ONE MORE TIME</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-07-04 23:02:30</p><p>We begin this week’s Raw with a look back at what happened in the last half hour of last week’s Raw with CM Punk’s comments after R Truth defeated John Cena in a tables match.</p><p>We are live on tape from Las Vegas, Nevada and your announcers are Michael ‘I don’t know if the fireworks tonight will be as good as last week’s’ Cole and Jerry ‘I thought WSOP stood for World Series of Puppies’ Lawler.</p><p>We see that there is a number one contender match to determine who replaces CM Punk as John Cena’s opponent at Money in the Bank. R Truth, Rey Mysterio, and Alberto Del Rio will find out who is the man. We will also see Miz face Alex Riley.</p><p>John Cena comes out and he has a heavy heart as he makes his way to the ring. He does not have the same spring in his step that he usually has when he comes to the ring. John takes the mic and he says that there is major unrest in the WWE Universe. Apparently CM Punk said some things that did not mesh well with the brass in WWE. Because of Punk’s recent outburst, Punk has been suspended indefinitely. Cena says that means that he is also stripped of his right to compete in his last match in his home town to face Cena for the title at Money in the Bank. Tonight, there is a remedy set by the WWE to give him a replacement number one contender.</p><p>As for CM Punk, we are supposed to sweep him under the rug, ignore his outbursts and pretend like he never existed. Cena says that he has never seen eye to eye with CM Punk. As the WWE Champion, he wants to weigh in on the situation and he says that it sucks. Punk and him don’t agree on everything especially loyalty to the brand. What Punk has said that he would with the title is no what Cena would do. Punk has been suspended for speaking his mind. He has been suspended for telling people how he feels.</p><p>Cena says that he knows that that this is a PG show and Punk’s outburst was at his expense. Cena says that he did not agree with what Punk said, but he finds nothing wrong with what Punk said. Cena asks the WWE Universe and the people who are supposed to have a voice where does this stop. Where does the WWE stop. There was an incident where Daniel Bryan was fired for being too aggressive. There has been speculation that WWE representatives confiscate signs that fans bring to the shows.</p><p>CM Punk has been suspended indefinitely for speaking his mind?</p><p>Cena says that fans are chanting ‘First Amendment’ and Cena mentions that it deals with free speech. If they take that away, then what is next? Cena says that he is no fashion icon and he says that he looks like the Kool Aid man in jorts. Cena asks what if I can’t be me. Will he be suspended indefinitely? Will the fans be asked to look a certain way. That is not why he is in this company and that is not why he defends the title.</p><p>Cena tells Cole that this problem is bigger than e-mailing back and forth on computer so there won’t be any general manager interruption during his tirade. Cena says that he wants answers from the man who made this decision, Vincent Kennedy McMahon. Cena apologizes to the general manager for going over his or her head. Cena says that he called Vince and he is on his way to Las Vegas on his private jet and he will be in the building.</p><p>Cena says that they are not going to talk about this in the back. They will do it in the ring tonight. Cena says that you will hear from the WWE Champion that he wants to face CM Punk at Money in the Bank.</p><p>Truth bumps into Alberto Del Rio who happens to be walking by him. Truth says that now he has to deal with senor Jimmy. Truth says that it ain’t fair and it ain’t right.</p><p>Del Rio says that it isn’t about fair. It is about destiny and it is his destiny to become the number one contender tonight.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio versus R Truth versus Rey Mysterio in a Number One Contender Match</strong></p><p>Del Rio goes after Truth and he punches and kicks him in the corner.
