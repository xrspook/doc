Del Rio drove a car in, put over his win last week against Orton, and his match with Sheamus. Del Rio went for Mathews until Kane came out. Mathews ran and Kane said his therapist wants him to apologize to Josh. Pretty funny. Teddy Long came out and booked an impromptu match.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio defeated Kane. Del Rio won thanks to a Ricardo distraction. After the match Kane attacked Josh again and gave him a chokeslam. I remember seeing a hell of a match in the XWF here between Kid Kash and Josh Mathews, but he didn't take the slam well.</p><p>Dark Match</p><p>Sheamus defeated Randy Orton and Alberto Del Rio in a Triple Threat for the World Hvt. Championship. Not a bad dark match at all. It went 7 minutes. Del Rio accidentally kicked Ricardo, which the crowd loved, and Sheamus got the pin. Sheamus and Lilian went around the crowd ringside to close out the night.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/252762">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/252762</a></p>
