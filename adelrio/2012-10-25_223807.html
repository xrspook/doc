Apparently Brodus Clay could not get the lackey waiver that Alex Riley had and he is not in the back of Del Rio’s car.</p><p>Del Rio tells us who he is . . . but we already knew that. He says that we already know what happened last week with the Big Show. We go to the same video package that was shown on every WWE show last week, but we got a spot shadow on Ricardo Rodriguez running from the car.</p><p>Alberto says that it was an accident. Alberto wants Ricardo to tell them what happened. Ricardo tells everyone what happened, but he says it in Spanish. Alberto says that a lot of people make the same mistake, just like the Big Show. He blames Big Show for everything.</p><p>He says that bad things happen to bad people. Alberto says that he is a nice guy, but business is business. That is why Big Show owes him money for damaging his car, and Ricardo will send him the bill. Alberto tells Big Show to get well soon and then he does the Del Rio wink.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/58467/ongoing-wwe-raw-report-little-jimmy-messes-with-the-feed-on-truths-opening-conspiracy-rant-dolph-ziggler-is-back.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/58467/ongoing-wwe-raw-report-little-jimmy-messes-with-the-feed-on-truths-opening-conspiracy-rant-dolph-ziggler-is-back.html?p=1</a></p>
