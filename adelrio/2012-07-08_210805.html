BRYAN AND MORE: 7/7 WWE SMACKDOWN IN EL PASO, TEXAS LIVE REPORT</strong><br><br>By Mista Binks on 2012-07-08 08:25:53<br><br>WWE SmackDown Live Event<br>El Paso Coliseum<br>El Paso, Texas<br>July 7, 2012<br><br>Just shy of a sell out. There were a couple of empty rows in each corner of the Coliseum. The last two events at the Coliseum (both Raw live events) were legit sell outs. The new'ish SmackDown live event stage is pretty nice. The production creates a Twitter hashtag to use (#wweelpaso) and displays various tweets on the big screens.<br><br>The event ran very smoothly. The renovations at the El Paso Coliseum have turned out very well. <br><br>Sheamus defeated Alberto Del Rio with the brogue kick. Line of the night: ADR is on the mic and asks the crowd "Are you really cheering this guy?" The crowd responds positively. "I am the Mexican here!" he replied. The had the crowd in stitches.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=69984">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=69984</a> </p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From El Paso, TX (7/7) - Punk Pays Tribute, Kane Vs. Jericho</strong><br><br>By Raj Giri July 08, 2012<br><br>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Adrian Telas for sending in these results from last night's Smackdown live event in El Paso, Texas:<br><br>What an unbelievable show here at the El Paso County Coliseum. The arena was not a complete sell out but it was very close, but most importantly the fans were into the show since the opening bell rang. Here are the results with some notes.<br><br>Sheamus defeated Alberto Del Rio to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Sheamus came out to a huge pop, while Del Rio had a mixed reaction but then got heat for calling the home crowd "wetbacks." The finisher saw Sheamus give Del Rio the Brogue kick. Also I got a Sheamus autograph on my authentic spinner belt, just thought I would throw that in there.<br><br>Biggest Pops:<br>1) CM Punk<br>2) Sheamus<br>3) Sin Cara<br><br>Mixed Reactions (No one really had heavy heat):<br>1) Daniel Bryan<br>2) Chris Jericho<br>3) Alberto Del Rio<br><br>As noted above, this was not a complete sellout, but it was very close. This was also my step-dad's first wrestling event live and he had a blast, not only from the great matches, but from the crowd. CM Punk did a little Eddie tribute by also doing his dance and shaking of the shoulders after his match. If you haven't seen the new entrance for live events might, I must say that it looks awesome and gives the show a better feel. I have been to a few live events in the past, but this was by far the best I have been to. Please bring a live Raw or Smackdown to El Paso, I think it's time that they do.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0708/554118/cm-punk/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0708/554118/cm-punk/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Another Detailed Set Of Results From Last Night's SmackDown Live Event In El Paso</strong><br><br>By Raj Giri July 08, 2012<br><br>Here is another set of results from last night's SmackDown live event in El Paso, TX from WrestlingINC.com reader Matthew Herschede:<br><br>There were lots of CM Punk and John Cena shirts. I saw whole sections wearing the white CM Punk shirt. It was unreal.<br><br>Match 5: World Heavyweight Championship, Alberto Del Rio vs. Sheamus. ADR comes out to some cheers and signs, but when the loud pop hit for Sheamus, he grabs a mic and says Sheamus can have us, because the citizens of El Paso aren't real Mexicans, they are peasants, just like Sheamus. Sheamus grabs a mic and tells ADR that win or lose, he's kicking ADR's arse for what he did on Tuesday at Smackdown Live. Great match, lots of back and forth. There were a couple of interferences by Ricardo Rodrigez. ADR locks in the cross-arm breaker, Sheamus picks him up and slams him. He hits White Noise, ADR kicks out at 2. ADR goes for his corner head kick, and connects with Ricardo; Sheamus hits the Brogue kick, and gets the clean win.<br><br>Pop of the Night - CM Punk, Sin Cara a close second.<br><br>Match of the Night - Sheamus vs. ADR<br><br>Yawn of the Night - Divas match, Jinder Mahal<br><br>Spot of the Night - Sin Cara's new finisher. I hope he does it on air.<br><br>Surprise of the Night - Drew. He seemed to be getting a really good warm reaction, for someone who hasn't been on air in quite some time. He'd make a good face, I'd enjoy seeing it.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0708/554121/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0708/554121/</a> <br></p>
