Professing his love for confrontation, The Viper, who defeated The Mexican Aristocrat Monday mere moments after World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus interrupted a referee’s pinfall count, stated that he deserved to be the next No. 1 contender for The Great White’s illustrious title.</p><p>The Celtic Warrior himself then made his way to the ring, relishing the idea of defending his championship gold against WWE’s Apex Predator.</p><p>SmackDown General Manager Booker T soon joined two of SmackDown’s best in the ring, acknowledging Orton's ability before turning to the controversy that resulted from SummerSlam’s World Title Match and the events on Monday's Raw. However, before he could start, he was quickly interrupted by a livid Del Rio, who proceeded to call Sheamus a “cheater and a criminal,” Orton a "a crazy animal" and questioned the five-time WCW Champion’s intelligence.</p><p>The SmackDown GM conceded leaning toward granting Del Rio another World Title opportunity — until the well-heeled competitor commenced his inappropriate rant. Instead, Booker decreed that The Mexican Aristocrat and The Viper would square off in the main event to determine who deserves the coveted status of No. 1 contender to the reigning World Heavyweight Champion.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Del Rio overcame Orton to become the No. 1 contender for World Heavyweight Title</strong></p><p>BY Matthew Artus August 24, 2012</p><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio def. Randy Orton to become the new No. 1 contender to the World Title</strong></p><p>Seeking a new title opportunity against World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, Alberto Del Rio brought his temper under control before battling Randy Orton in the main event on SmackDown.</p><p>With the No. 1 contender status at stake, both The Mexican Aristocrat and WWE’s Apex Predator showed no mercy — no easy feat considering The Celtic Warrior kept a close eye on the action while joining Michael Cole as the bout’s guest commentator.</p><p>In fierce showdown that could have gone either way at any moment, Del Rio inflicted serious damage on the arm of the always dangerous Viper in hopes of later exploiting the injured appendage with his signature finisher. And following a missed RKO attempt by Orton, the affluent grappler promptly capitalized by applying his Cross Armbreaker for an undisputable victory and the right to be called the No. 1 contender once again.</p><p>The Mexican Aristocrat taunted Sheamus following his win, eventually leveling the titleholder with his shoe and a strong roundhouse kick.</p><p>Then, as the smoke cleared, Dolph Ziggler emerged, looking to cash in his Money in the Bank Contract against a roughed up Celtic Warrior. However, the recovering Orton saved the weary champion from being obligated to participate in an impromptu title opportunity by connecting a well-timed RKO on The Showoff.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-08-24/results-26047869/page-8">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-08-24/results-26047869/page-8</a></p>
