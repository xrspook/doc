(See what I did there?) Expect that to change at Night of Champions, when RVD walks out with Alberto Del Rio’s World Heavyweight Title. WINNER: Rob Van Dam</p><p>Anthony Benigno: RVD has been a thorn in Alberto Del Rio’s side since he made his return, and having Ricardo Rodriguez in his corner makes the match personal. But Del Rio’s a clutch artist. Sorry, Rob. WINNER: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>Jake Grate: Since his return at Money in the Bank, RVD has shown the WWE Universe that he’s as exciting and innovative as ever. On the flipside, in the midst of his fourth World Title reign, Del Rio has looked as intense and dangerous as ever. In a close match-up, it’s a good bet to look at their recent encounters: “Mr. Pay-Per-View” is 2-0 against the World Heavyweight Champion, and with Ricardo Rodriguez by his side, he’ll make it a hat trick in Detroit and take Del Rio’s title. WINNER: Rob Van Dam</p><p>John Clapp: If you’re a fan of stiff strikes, the World Heavyweight Title Match is your cup of tea. Look for RVD to ride high thanks, in no small part, to whatever inside ball he’s gleaned from the man in his corner, Ricardo Rodriguez. WINNER: Rob Van Dam</p><p>James Wortman: If Alberto Del Rio isn’t nervous about this Sunday’s World Heavyweight Championship Match, he should be. With The Mexican Aristocrat’s former ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, standing in Rob Van Dam’s corner — in “The Whole Dam Show’s” home state, no less — it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which the crowd inside Michigan’s Joe Louis Arena isn’t chanting “RVD! RVD RVD!” at the end of this one. WINNER: Rob Van Dam</p><p>Rob Van Dam: 4; Alberto Del Rio: 1<br></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/2013/night-of-champions-2013-predictions-26147710/page-4">http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/2013/night-of-champions-2013-predictions-26147710/page-4</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Night of Champions 2013 predictions</strong></p><p>BY WWE.com Staff</p><p>September 13, 2013</p><p></p><p>The WWE Universe is about to bear witnes to some epic clashes; from scorching-hot Daniel Bryan battling WWE Champion Randy Orton with the title on the line, to the very real possibility that CM Punk will get his payback-ready hands on Paul Heyman, Night of Champions is going to be a night to remember.<br></p><p>And, as the pay-per-view draws ever nearer, WWE.com’s editorial team has argued incessantly about who will walk away victorious Sunday night. And why shouldn't we? Ultimately, we decided it would be best to voice our opinions on the website, and not just at one another angrily in the cafeteria.</p><p>So here they are — take ‘em or leave ‘em, it’s the WWE.com editorial staff’s Night of Champions 2013 predictions. And be sure to see how we did by tuning in to Night of Champions, starting with an action-packed Kickoff that streams live Sunday starting at 7:30 p.m. ET/4:30 p.m. PT.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/2013/night-of-champions-2013-predictions-26147710">http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/2013/night-of-champions-2013-predictions-26147710</a></p><p></p><p></p><p>Picking the winners</p><p>Who will be celebrating when the dust clears at Night of Champions?
