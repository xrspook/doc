Interestingly, the graphic they showed on the screen included an old pic of Del Rio holding the World Heavyweight Championship Belt.</p><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio defeated Jack Swagger (Street Fight)</strong></p><p>Swagger came out with a "Don't Tread On Me" flag over his shoulders to some very real heat. This area has a pretty substantial Latin population, so it was definitely not a surprise that it was pro-Del Rio. Swagger cut a promo before giving the mic to Colter, who referred to Odessa as Oklahoma, then Lubbock in order to draw heat. He also asked how many "undocumented workers" were in the building, and got a pretty decent cheer in return.</p><p>Ricardo was introduced to a strong pop, and introduced Del Rio to an even bigger pop. After both were in the ring, they announced that it would be a street fight.</p><p>Del Rio grabbed the flag that Swagger had hung over the ropes and teased throwing the flag into the crowd. When Swagger came after the flag, ADR played bullfighter with him, causing Swagger to miss it a few times, before finally throwing it into the crowd. At some point while this was going on, a "You hurt Ziggler!" chant broke out in the ringside area, which might have been the funniest moment of the night.</p><p>Once the match got going, they went into the crowd and up on the ramp right off the bat. Swagger focused on ADR's ankle early, and pulled out a table (which got set aside without being used) and a kendo stick (which got used immediately and often). Swagger got an ankle lock in, but got out after Rodriguez tossed him a kendo stick. After about 15 minutes of back and forth, AJ and Big E showed up. ADR took a Big Ending, but kicked out of Swagger's pin attempt. Almost immediately, ADR countered a gut wrench attempt into a cross arm breaker for the tap. Bell-to-bell, the match went 17 minutes.</p><p>Overall, it was a decent show, if a predictable one. The only result that surprised me a little was the DiBiase/Graves match, simply cause I thought they might give the young up-and-comer the win over a guy whose stock has fallen as far as DiBiase's has.</p><p>Pops of the Night: 1. Orton 2. Del Rio 3. Rodriguez</p><p>Most Heat: 1. Swagger 2. Barrett 3. Graves</p><p>Best Matches: 1. Del Rio def Swagger 2. Barrett def Gabriel 3. DiBiase def Graves</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0512/562640/wwe-live-event-results/index-2.shtml">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0512/562640/wwe-live-event-results/index-2.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE House Show Results 05.11.13 - Odessa, Texas</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 05.12.2013</p><p>There were 8,600 people in a mostly full building.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio beat Jack Swagger in a crowd's choice Street Fight. The crowd could have also picked a 2 out of 3 Falls match. A good match. A.J. Lee and Big E Langston did a run in during the match.</p><p>The crowd was pissed Dolph Ziggler was pulled. Smackdown needs some talent. This was one of the worst WWE shows I have been to.</p><p>Biggest Pop 1. Alberto Del Rio 2. Randy Orton 3. The Big Show</p><p>Biggest Heat 1. Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter 2. Damien Sandow and Cody Rhodes 3. The announcement that Dolph Ziggler was not going to be there.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/283751">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/283751</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
