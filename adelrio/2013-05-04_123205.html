Little did the people who were watching Raw that John Cena would be the victim of the wrath of the Shield. Then Ryback made his way to the ring in his leather jacket. Who’s next to be fed to Ryback? Will it be John Cena?</p><p>We are in Detroit, Michigan and your announcers are John ‘Gordie Howe Hat Tricks on Friday Night’ Layfield, Josh ‘Bob Beattie’ Mathews, and Michael ‘Norris Division Hockey’ Cole.</p><p>It is time to talk about the World Title situation and the Triple Threat Match that gave us the ladder match at Extreme Rules.</p><p>Renee Young is in the interview area with Ricardo Rodriguez. She asks Ricardo about his match against Zeb Colter tonight. Ricardo speaks in Spanish and then he kisses Renee. Alberto stops by and he tells Ricardo to relax and get a hold of himself. They need to get ready.</p><p>Renee Young is in the interview area with Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter. Renee asks Zeb about getting revenge for his loss. Zeb calls Renee ‘Rhonda’ and she says that as a part of the lamestream media that they twist and distort the facts. Zeb says that he had a 102 temperature and vertigo, but he went to work like any Real American.</p><p>The people on Twitter were calling his performance inspiring. What hurt him most is that his victory was awarded to an illegal immigrant who snuck across our border. Ricardo is guilty of theft and he could go to the police about this. He will do this himself. He will rectify this situation. There will be no taint on his victory because Real Americans play fair.</p><p>We have some guests at the announce table. Dolph Ziggler, AJ Lee, and Big E Langston are joining John, Michael, and Josh.</p><p><strong>Match Number Three: Ricardo Rodriguez (with Alberto Del Rio) versus Zeb Colter (with Jack Swagger)</strong></p><p>Colter pushes and slaps Ricardo but Ricardo grabs Colter by the mustache and he stomps on the foot and hand. Ricardo rides Zeb like a government mule and then Zeb with a rake of the eyes. Colter punches Ricardo and then he says something to Alberto.</p><p>Zeb with another punch to Ricardo. Colter says something to Del Rio but he turns around and punches Colter. Ricardo with a savate kick or two to Colter. Del Rio tells Ricardo to go for the knee into the corner but Swagger interferes and he clotheslines Ricardo. The referee calls for the bell.</p><p>Winner: Ricardo Rodriguez (by disqualification)</p><p>After the match, Ricardo and Alberto fight in the ring. Alberto clotheslines Jack over the top rope and then Zeb leaves the ring. Teddy Long’s music plays and since he is the assistant to Booker T, he has the power to take the four men in the ring and make a tag match out of things.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez versus Zeb Colter and Jack Swagger</strong></p><p>The match is joined in progress and Colter punches Ricardo while the referee deals with Alberto and Jack. Jack with an Irish whip but he misses a charge into the corner when Ricardo floats over. Alberto and Jack tag in and Del Rio with two clotheslines and a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with punches to the kidney but Swagger with an elbow. Del Rio with an arm breaker and he applies the cross arm breaker and Ziggler and Langston attack Del Rio and Swagger.</p><p>No Contest</p><p>After the match, Ziggler and Langston attack Swagger and Del Rio.</p><p>Teddy Long comes out again and he has decided that there are not enough teams in this match so he has made this a Triple Threat Tag Match.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez versus Zeb Colter and Jack Swagger versus Big E Langston and Dolph Ziggler</strong></p><p>Ziggler and Del Rio start and Del Rio with punches and a snap mare. Del Rio with a kick to the back and he gets a near fall. Ricardo tags in and he kicks Ziggler in the chest and gets a near fall. Ricardo with a sliding kick to the head and he tags in Del Rio, who kicks Ziggler in the shoulder and gets a near fall.</p><p>Ziggler with a kick to the knee and a drop kick. Langston tags in and he punches Del Rio followed by a belly-to-belly suplex. Langston runs Del Rio into the corner and he connects with a shoulder into the corner.

Ricardo battles with Ricardo but Ricardo runs into Langston and goes down. Swagger with a belly-to-belly slam to Langston. Del Rio with an enzuigiri to Swagger but Ziggler with a rollup for a near fall.</p><p>Del Rio applies the cross arm breaker and Ziggler tags out.</p><p>Winners: Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/77327/wwe-smackdown-report-mark-henry-and-sheamus-go-over-the-top-does-ryback-feed-on-goat-kane-versus-dean-ambrose-a-new-match-announced-for-extreme-rules-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/77327/wwe-smackdown-report-mark-henry-and-sheamus-go-over-the-top-does-ryback-feed-on-goat-kane-versus-dean-ambrose-a-new-match-announced-for-extreme-rules-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
