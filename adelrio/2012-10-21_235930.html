Alberto says that it is time for him to go and the interview is over. Alberto says that he will think about the match.</p><p>Christian gives him one to think about and he slaps Alberto in the face. Alberto takes off his jacket and scarf and instead of attacking Christian, he leaves the ring. Alberto says that he is done with Christian. He says that his answer is no.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio has joined Matt and Todd at the announce table. Matt is excited to have Alberto at the announce table with them and Todd wonders why Alberto is at the announce table. Matt asks Alberto about Christian and he says that Christian is a nobody and does not deserve to be in the ring with him. He says that Christian has no class.
