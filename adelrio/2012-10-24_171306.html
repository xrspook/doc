THE FINAL CHAPTER?; A NEW FACE ON SMACKDOWN MAKES HIS IMPACT</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-01-07 21:59:57</p><p>We are live on tape from Tucson, Arizona and your announcers are Matt ‘Steve Kerr’ Striker, Josh ‘Kenny Lofton’ Mathews, and Michael ‘Last Announcer Standing’ Cole.</p><p>Cole, Striker, and Mathews talk about the two main events. They first talk about the final match between Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio in a two out of three falls match. Then they talk about the Last Man Standing Match between Edge and Kane for the World Title.</p><p>Before our main event, Alberto Del Rio reminds us who he is. On Monday night, he proved to the idiot rapper R Truth that the truth is no match for destiny and his destiny is to win the Royal Rumble and be the main event at Wrestlemania. Tonight, he is going to destroy Rey Mysterio. There are only two types of Latino, the Puro Latino and the gardners, car washers, and his little amigito Rey Mysterio.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: Rey Mysterio versus Alberto Del Rio in a Two out of Three Falls Match</strong></p><p>Fall Number One8:22</p><p>Alberto with kicks to Rey at the start of the match and he sends Rey into the turnbuckles. Alberto chokes Rey in the corner. Alberto with an Irish whip but he runs into a boot from Rey. Alberto with a kick but Rey with a kick of his own followed by a head scissors and 619 attempt. Alberto is able to duck the 619 and then he puts Rey in the cross arm breaker. Rey tries to fight out of the hold but then he sacrifices this fall by tapping out to possibly help him in the other two falls.</p><p>Fall Number One to Alberto Del Rio [Del Rio 1 Fall, Mysterio 0 Falls]</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>Fall Number Two</p><p>We join the second fall in progress and Del Rio with an arm bar but Rey with forearms.

Alberto tries for another tilt-a-whirl back breaker but Rey lands on his feet. Del Rio with a kick and he throws Rey under the ropes to the floor. Del Rio takes too much time to gloat over his success so far in the match and that allows Rey to get back on the apron without any trouble.</p><p>Rey with a shoulder and forearms from the apron followed by a springboard head scissors that takes Del Rio to the mat. Rey holds his left arm because of the damage already done to it by Del Rio. Rey with a knee to Del Rio but Alberto with an Irish whip. Rey with an elbow. Del Rio tries for the cross arm breaker again, but he doesn’t have it locked in and that allows Rey to get a near fall with a rollup.</p><p>Rey with a drop toe hold and Alberto goes into the ropes. Del Rio gets back to his feet but Rey with a head scissors into a La Magistral for the three count.</p><p>Fall Number Two to Rey Mysterio [Del Rio 1 Fall, Mysterio 1 Fall]</p><p>We go to commercial before the third fall begins.</p><p>Fall Number Three</p><p>The third fall is joined in progress and Del Rio with a key lock. Rey with a series of kicks to escape the hold. Rey with a kick to the chest. Del Rio with a hard Irish whip and he gets a near fall. Del Rio puts Rey on the turnbuckles and appears to try to unmask Rey. Rey knocks Del Rio to the mat and he connects with a battering ram for a near fall. Rey with a springboard cross body for another near fall.</p><p>Rey with kicks to the ribs and then Rey tries for a springboard move but he does not connect, allowing Alberto to hit an arm breaker and get a near fall. Del Rio shows some frustration over not being able to finish Rey. Del Rio gets Rey on his shoulders but Rey gets to his feet and he hits a DDT and both men are down. Rey gets a near fall on Del Rio. Rey goes to the apron and takes his time climbing the turnbuckles for a moonsault but Alberto recovers and he crotches Rey and Rey is hanging from the turnbuckles in the tree of woe.</p><p>Alberto with a drop kick to the chest and Rey falls to the mat. Del Rio goes to the apron and he picks up Rey and tries to superplex Rey to the floor but Rey blocks it. Del Rio decides on Plan B and he drops Rey’s arm on the top rope. Del Rio sends Rey into the turnbuckles while on the apron. Rey kicks Del Rio in the knee and Alberto is in the turnbuckles, but on the apron. Rey with a 619 to Del Rio that sends him to the floor. Ricardo Rodriguez checks on Del Rio while Rey goes up top and Rey hits a cross body onto both men. Rey brings Del Rio back into the ring but Rey does not return to the ring immediately and he tries to get back into the ring in front of Rodriguez. Rodriguez grabs Rey’s legs to prevent him from returning to the ring and the referee makes the ten count.</p><p>Fall Number Three to Alberto Del Rio</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio [2 Falls to 1]</p><p>After the match, Rey shows his frustration and kicks the ring steps. While Del Rio has gone up the ramp, Ricardo Rodriguez remains at ringside, but Rodriguez is able to avoid Rey, but Rodriguez does not see Mysterio as he makes his way around the ring and Rey sends Rodriguez into the ringside barrier on the ramp. Rey kicks Rodriguez in the ribs and then Rey looks at Del Rio before kicking Rodriguez in the head. Rey sends Rodriguez into the ring and drop kicks Rodriguez into the back and Rey hits the 619 while Del Rio watches from the stage.</p><p>Rey points at Del Rio before hitting the springboard dive onto Rodriguez.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/54131/wwe-smackdown-report-last-man-standing-match-intercontinental-title-match-number-one-contender-match-del-riomysterio-the-final-chapter-a-new-face-on-smackdown-makes-his-impact.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/54131/wwe-smackdown-report-last-man-standing-match-intercontinental-title-match-number-one-contender-match-del-riomysterio-the-final-chapter-a-new-face-on-smackdown-makes-his-impact.html?p=1</a></p>
