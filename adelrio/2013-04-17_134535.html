The Ladder Match stipulation was chosen by Del Rio, who earned the right to name the rules after Ricardo Rodriguez won a Triple Threat involving Ziggler and Swagger’s seconds, Big E Langston and Zeb Colter, respectively.</p><p>When Ziggler cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to seize the World Title from an injured Del Rio one day after WrestleMania, it was only a matter of time before the former titleholder would charge back into the fray and attempt to reclaim his championship gold. Before the bell could ring on his rematch one week later, however, Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter engineered a star-spangled roadblock, interrupting the impending showdown and viciously attacking Del Rio.</p><p>Later that same night, the “Real American” added even more turmoil to the mix by overcoming Ziggler in a heated non-title contest, only to suffer a post-match assault of pure retribution by a re-emerging Del Rio. The Mexican Superstar ended the onslaught with an excruciating Cross Armbreaker hanging off the steel stage at the top of the ramp.</p><p>This completely changed the circumstances surrounding the World Title. While Del Rio was still entitled to his rematch against The Showoff, Swagger had now pinned the reigning champion. As a result, SmackDown General Manager Booker T decided that the Triple Threat was the only way to settle things — and WWE.com has since confirmed that the whirlwind matchup will take place at Extreme Rules.</p><p>The Triple Threat is a match that will stack the odds against the bleach-blond titleholder, not only because he has to defend against two former World Champions, but also because he doesn’t have to be beaten himself to lose the title. However, even though Del Rio and Swagger have tangled over a ladder in recent weeks — the “Real American” used a the weapon to best Del Rio in a No-Disqualification ladder on SmackDown — Ziggler isn’t without experience or success in this area: It was in a Ladder Match that the athletic “Showoff” upended John Cena at last year’s WWE TLC event.</p><p>Can The Showoff possibly walk out of the Triple Threat Match with the World Heavyweight Title still in his possession? Find out at Extreme Rules, Sunday, May 19 at 8/7 CT — only on pay-per-view.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/extremerules/2013/ziggler-del-rio-swagger-26108228">http://www.wwe.com/shows/extremerules/2013/ziggler-del-rio-swagger-26108228</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger - Triple Threat Match</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>April 16, 2013</p><p></p><p>At Extreme Rules, Dolph Ziggler will defend his newly captured World Heavyweight Championship against Alberto Del Rio and Jack Swagger in a fast-and-furious Triple Threat Match.</p><p>When Ziggler cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to seize the World Title from an injured Del Rio one day after WrestleMania, it was only a matter of time before the former titleholder would charge back into the fray and attempt to reclaim his championship gold.
