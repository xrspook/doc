Enclosed in the company's announcement is this photo of Triple H shaking Steen's hand at Full Sail University. In response to the news surfacing on Twitter, Rodriguez, who was released from his contract with WWE on July 30, took the opportunity to air out some grievances on Paul "Triple H" Levesque, WWE's Executive Vice President, Talent, Live Events and Creative.</p><p>Rodriguez wrote to Steen on the social media platform, "Congrats.. I hope he at least looked at you while shaking hands at one point and did call you fat as f--k. #OhMemories."</p><p>Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported last week that Rodriguez's weight was a problem with WWE officials and likely factored in his departure from the organization.</p><p>It remains unclear whether WWE opted to release Rodriguez from his contract as part of budget cuts or if he asked to be released from his contract. Those close to Rodriguez told Meltzer that he requested to be let go due to his frustration with not being utilized as a wrestler—he stopped being used as a wrestler after competing as the masked El Local at NXT Takeover. However, in the same report, Meltzer says he was cut two weeks before his contract was set to expire due to a talent purge that also included developmental wrestlers. Whatever the case may be, his excess weight hindered his chances of success as a wrestler in WWE. It was reported by Meltzer that officials in the organization did not feel his body met company standards, even when largely covered in a costume. The WWE set a weight loss goal for him, and he was having issues achieving and maintaining it. According to independent wrestler and friend Leva Bates, Rodriguez was suspended last year for a violation of WWE's drug testing policy due to fat burning supplements.</p><p>The former personal ring announcer of Alberto Del Rio also revealed that Triple H never referred to him by his name, but as "Bumblebee Man." Bumblebee Man is an overweight Hispanic cartoon character on The Simpsons who dresses in a bumblebee costume and performs slapstick comedy. It's also a caricature of a character from an old Mexican television comedy series.</p><p>"#BumbleBee was his name for me… Don't even think he ever knew my real name," Rodriguez stated.</p><p>Both messages have since been deleted.</p><p>Rodriguez may be joining Del Rio in AAA (Asistencia Asesoría y Administración) in the near future. Late last night on Twitter, he teased appearing for the promotion once his 90-day no-compete clause with WWE expires.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0812/579930/ricardo-rodriguez-talks-negative-experiences-with-triple-h/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wrestlinginc_news+%28WrestlingInc.com+Pro+Wrestling+News%29">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0812/579930/ricardo-rodriguez-talks-negative-experiences-with-triple-h/?utm<em>source=feedburner&utm</em>medium=feed&utm<em>campaign=Feed%3A+wrestlinginc</em>news+%28WrestlingInc.com+Pro+Wrestling+News%29</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>[新闻] 8月11日新闻--关于Ricardo Rodriguez的辞职</strong></p><p>4.此前报道过Ricardo Rodriguez要求离开WWE是因为他感到不满，希望成为一名摔角手。</p><p>Ricardo一直在扮演El Local和Kalisto在NXT搭档，但是当他受伤后，Sin Cara得到了和Kalisto搭档的位置。</p><p>Ricardo的体形也有问题，不符合WWE的标准。据报道他们给他设定了体重目标，而在他们看来他保持这个体重有困难。</p><p>Rodriguez同时有选手合同和解说合同。当他离开时，他的选手合同只有两周就到期了。他一直在进行西班牙语解说，但是随着正在进行的成本削减，三人西班牙语解说团队太多了。</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.19977.com/thread-8892280-1-1.html">http://www.19977.com/thread-8892280-1-1.html</a></p>
