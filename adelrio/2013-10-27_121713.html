Here are some highlights from the interview.</p><p>Having fought MMA: "This was part of my world. Eight, nine years ago I was fighting in Japan, Korea, Mexico, Brazil. And that's the reason I'm here, because I love this. I love and admire all the things these guys are doing right now. These guys are fantastic. They put on a great show tonight for everybody here."</p><p>If he can fight again after his wrestling career: "Not anymore, that's part of my past. I had a lot of fun when I was doing it. I was making a lot of money, but luckily for me, WWE treats me so well that I don't need to step in the octagon, or in the ring for MMA again."</p><p>Dream Wrestlemania match: "Undertaker, baby. Undertaker. Undertaker is like the godfather of wrestling. That would be my dream match. I don't know if it's going to happen, because we know we only have like one or two years more to enjoy Undertaker with us. So, hopefully if it's going to be next year or the following one [that he would face Undertaker]. If it happens, great. If it never happens, that's fine because I admire him no matter what."</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1029/566856/alberto-del-rio-talks-dream-wrestlemania-opponent/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1029/566856/alberto-del-rio-talks-dream-wrestlemania-opponent/</a></p>
