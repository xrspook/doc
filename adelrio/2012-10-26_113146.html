John Morrison</strong></p><p></p><p>Still fuming from the news that he must compete in a Triple Threat Hell in a Cell Match at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Alberto Del Rio looked ready to steamroll any and all comers. Unfortunately for John Morrison, he found himself directly in Del Rio’s path. The furious Mexican allowed Morrison no quarter in their singles match, neutralizing JoMo’s high-energy assault and snapping on the cross armbreaker for the win. And, perhaps more importantly to The Mexican Aristocrat, sending a message to his Hell in a Cell opponents, WWE Champion John Cena and CM Punk.</p><p><strong>Triple H announced WWE Champion John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. CM Punk in a Triple Threat Hell in a Cell Match, promised to fire someone</strong></p><p>Triple H was steamed. Less than 24 hours earlier, at Night of Champions, WWE’s Chief Operating Officer competed against CM Punk. Although he prevailed in the bout and retained his position as COO, The Game was nonetheless furious about how it all went down. Not only did The Miz & R-Truth attempt to interfere in the bout, an already terminated Kevin Nash marched through the crowd and amubushed both men.</p><p>Perhaps feeling badly about how events transpired the night before, Triple H informed his now respected rival, Punk, that he was being included in a Triple Threat Hell in a Cell Match against newly crowned WWE Champion John Cena and Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>The Voice of the Voiceless appeared pleased to hear he would receive a title opportunity in two weeks, but he was hardly finished making a statement. He began to expound on who he thought was behind the odd incidents of the previous several weeks.</p><p>Before Punk could reveal the full extent of his hypothesis, WWE’s Executive Vice President of Talent Relations, John Laurinaitis emerged. The Second City Savior then explained that he felt the Executive VP was the mastermind behind the shenanigans. When The Game asked Laurinaitis if Punk was telling the truth, however, Laurinaitis appeared evasive. When Executive VP attempted to fire the anti-establishment Superstar, Triple H immediately reversed the decision. WWE’s COO did insist, however, that by the end of the night someone would be fired.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-09-19/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-09-19/results</a></p>
