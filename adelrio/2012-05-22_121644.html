Alberto Del Rio</strong><br><br>In a bit of high comedy, Santino Marella made fun of Ricardo Rodriguez's eyebrows, saying they looked like "caterpillars," and the two proceeded to get into a duel over who can roll their "R"s better. After the verbal spat, Santino struck Ricardo with The Cobra and did his best impersonation of Ricardo by introducing Alberto Del Rio for his match against Randy Orton.<br><br>Del Rio repeatedly targeted Orton's shoulder throughout the contest, trying to soften him up for the Cross Armbreaker. Although clearly ailing, The Viper found his second wind and planted The Mexican Aristocrat with a vicious DDT off the second rope. Before he could finish Del Rio off with an RKO, however, Chris Jericho came out of nowhere and planted his knees into Orton's face with a Codebreaker. Not satisfied there, Jericho delivered two more Codebreakers on Orton, sandwiched between relentless taunts of "I am the best in the world at everything I do!" The Mental Mastermind definitely made a powerful statement coming off his loss in the Fatal 4-Way Match at WWE Over the Limit.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2012-05-21/wwe-raw-results/page-5">http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2012-05-21/wwe-raw-results/page-5</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Raw SuperShow results: Massive brawl breaks out and John Cena gets knocked out</strong><br><br>BY Tom Herrera May 21, 2012<br><br><strong>John Cena and Sheamus vs. Tensai, Dolph Ziggler and Jack Swagger ended in a No Contest (2-on-3 Handicap Lumberjack Match)</strong><br><br>From the early going, there was no doubt that John Cena and Sheamus had their work cut out for them. Isolating The Great White at a distance from his tag team partner, Tensai twisted and yanked on Sheamus' head like it was a stripped screw. After Sheamus was tossed to the outside, the lumberjacks let loose with a flurry of punches and kicks, further weakening The Celtic Warrior. Every time Sheamus appeared closer to mounting a rally, the trio of Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger and Tensai made sure to stop him right in his tracks.<br><br>Remarkably, Sheamus found the momentum he needed to tag Cena by executing a rolling senton against Ziggler, and The Cenation Leader followed with a couple of turbocharged shoulder blocks. The comeback wouldn't last long, though, as the lumberjacks pulled Sheamus off the apron and promptly mauled The Great White before storming the ring to turn their attention to Cena. A huge brawl then broke out as the locker room emptied and a horde of Superstars rushed to the ring to exchange blows with the lumberjacks. Meanwhile, Big Show watched all the chaos unfold from the stage.<br><br>The melee raged on and Cena went to the backstage area in search of The World's Largest Athlete, but found himself face-to-face with Laurinaitis instead. The General Manager reiterated to Cena that he wasn't allowed to lay a finger on him or else the Cenation leader would be terminated. As Cena turned away from Laurinaitis, he was knocked out cold by Big Show's ferocious WMD for the second night in a row.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2012-05-21/wwe-raw-results/page-1">http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2012-05-21/wwe-raw-results/page-1</a> <br></p>
