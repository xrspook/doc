We will have a tag match based on what happened on Raw. Randy Orton was giving an RKO to Daniel Bryan at the end of Smackdown. On Raw, they were kind of buddy buddy.

Maybe Teddy should rearrange his thoughts because tonight is just a taste of what he is going to do to Alberto Del Rio on Sunday.</p><p>Teddy is about to eat but he is interrupted by Big E Langston who takes the burger and eats it in front of Teddy. He gives what is left of the burger to Teddy and Teddy starts to cry.</p><p>We are back with a WWE Rewind: Footage of the concussion suffered by Dolph Ziggler.</p><p><strong>Match Number Three: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) and Chris Jericho versus Dolph Ziggler and Big E Langston (with AJ Lee) in a Set up on Raw Match</strong></p><p>Ziggler has something to say to Del Rio before anyone locks up.
