El Patron noted that another person will be joining Lucha Underground in the next few weeks that made him want to be a part of the organization. You can check out the full interview here, below are some highlights:</p><p>His debut night in Lucha Underground:</p><p>"It was fantastic! I cannot even describe how I was feeling that night. The crowd was amazing and I was finally doing what I love and being me, completely me, and not pretending to be somebody else. And I'm pretty sure all the audience can see that and that's the reason they enjoyed it so much."</p><p>Expectations from Lucha Underground on his work:</p><p>"They want to see the Alberto that they've seen through the years so I don't have to change much. I'll incorporate more Lucha Libre moves to my repertoire but people like what I've done through the years. I'll show more moves, things that I didn't do in the other company because they wouldn't let me do it."</p><p>Being familiar with the other wrestlers in Lucha Underground:</p><p>"<strong>Some of them are my friends from Mexico, some others that I want to join the company pretty soon. And I can't really tell you who but last week we got another person who is going to join Underground in the next three or four weeks and when I found out he was going to be a part of it, I had to be a part of it too.</strong>"</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0225/589796/alberto-el-patron-says-person-joining-lucha-underground-soon/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0225/589796/alberto-el-patron-says-person-joining-lucha-underground-soon/</a></p>
