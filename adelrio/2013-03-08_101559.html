To begin your journey, simply click on one of the ring warriors above, and be sure to check back regularly for updates as WWE continues its way to The Show of Shows at MetLife Stadium.</p><p>01</p><p>Strategic successThanks to an innovative assist from Ricardo Rodriguez — who duct-tapes Big Show's ankles around the bottom rope, preventing the giant from regaining a vertical base — Alberto Del Rio emerges from his Last Man Standing Match at Royal Rumble as World Heavyweight Champion. Making the evening all the more special for "The Essence of Excellence" is the pre-match endorsement he receives from WWE Hall of Famer Bret "Hit Man" Hart. http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-01-28/40048076852</p><p>02</p><p>A merciless muggingDisregarding the Body Slam Challenge that brings him back into the ring with Alberto Del Rio less than 24 hours removed from their World Heavyweight Title clash, Big Show tries to even the score with a methodical and disturbing attack. Show KO's Del Rio and, in a heinous reversal of events the night before, duct-tapes the World Champion's lifeless arm to the rope, leaving him defenseless against a second devastating KO Punch.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-01-29/40048759117</p><p>03</p><p>Pushed to the brinkWith their rivalry spiraling out of control, a steel pipe–wielding Alberto Del Rio greets Big Show in the parking lot and sends the big man searching for an escape car. The Mexican hero exorcises some of his rage in a win over Dolph Ziggler, but the taste of victory turns sour when Show appears on the TitanTron with Ricardo Rodriguez by his side and unleashes a KO Punch on the World Champion's comrade.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-02-02/40049483169</p><p>04</p><p>Room serviceHaving just disposed of Cody Rhodes with the Cross Armbreaker, Alberto Del Rio offers a rematch to Big Show, who appears via satellite from the safety of his hotel room. The giant balks at signing the paperwork in the ring, instead demanding it be sent to his hotel room. Although Del Rio relents, he follows the courier to Big Show's room and KO's the giant with a fire extinguisher in the hotel hallway.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-02-05/40048673116</p><p>05</p><p>Technically suspendedAlberto Del Rio's repeat attacks earn him a one-night suspension from SmackDown General Manager Booker T, but the decree doesn't prevent Del Rio from befriending Big Show's disgruntled bus driver, gaining access to the Superstar's custom ride and stripping it of its rear wheels. As a flabbergasted Big Show contemplates his run of bad luck, a bucket of orange paint empties onto the 7-foot, 441-pound bully. http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-02-09/40049311835</p><p>06</p><p>Alberto the Giant SlayerDebunking speculation he couldn't defeat the massive Big Show without the help of a commentator's desk or duct tape, Alberto Del Rio does the unthinkable and makes the giant tap out to the Cross Armbreaker. With Show's beef seemingly quashed, Del Rio speaks about defending his title at WrestleMania against Elimination Chamber Match winner Jack Swagger: "This is my son, this is my baby and I'm going to defend it with everything."http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-02-18/40049502365</p><p>07</p><p>Averting the cash-inIn a rematch against "Mr. Money in the Bank" Dolph Ziggler, Alberto Del Rio finds himself having to fend off not only Ziggler but also his mountain of muscle at ringside, Big E Langston. The Mexican Superstar prevails in the fast-paced contest, but a post-match beatdown by Big E leaves him vulnerable to a Money in the Bank contract cash-in attempt. Before The Showoff can formally declare his challenge, however, Ricardo Rodriguez intercepts the briefcase. http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-02-19/40049730403</p><p>08</p><p>Si, the peopleDescribing his World Title as the "result of the American Dream," Alberto Del Rio responds passionately to Jack Swagger & Zeb Colter's "State of the Union" address, disavowing their allegation that all immigrants are guilty of stealing opportunities from "real Americans." He caps his heartfelt retort by challenging Swagger to a fight. Instead, Del Rio sees action against Wade Barrett, whom he beats with Swagger & Colter observing from the entrance ramp. http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-02-23/40049514407</p><p>09</p><p>Philosophy clashAlberto Del Rio & Ricardo Rodriguez come face-to-face with Jack Swagger & Zeb Colter on a highly controversial edition of "Miz TV." The outspoken Colter drops statistics on "illegals" and continues espousing his xenophobic assertions until Del Rio can hear no more and reminds them of America's immigrant roots. "America doesn't belong to you," he says. "America doesn't belong to me. America's the greatest country on earth because it belongs to everyone."http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-02-26/40049308032</p><p>10</p><p>'Jack' of all tradesWith an insulting flick of Jim Ross' 10 gallon hat, Jack Swagger earns the ire of not only his fellow Oklahomans, but also the World Heavyweight Champion. The former NCAA All-American corners J.R. after the Hall of Fame announcer, who helped recruit Swagger to WWE, objects to the tone of Swagger & Zeb Colter's discourse. Noting that he detests bullies, Alberto Del Rio swoops in and declares Swagger less a "Real American" than a real "jackass."http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-02/40048988954</p><p>11</p><p>Clash of championsEnraged over Jack Swagger's bullying of patriotic WWE Hall of Famers Jim Duggan, Sgt. Slaughter and Dusty Rhodes, Alberto Del Rio bum-rushes the "Real American" backstage before security quickly breaks up the brawl. The hectic pull-apart — the first instance of physical contact between the two —seemingly invigorates Del Rio, who again turns back a competitive challenge from Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-05/40048898419</p><p>12</p><p>A laugh at Swagger’s expenseImitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but Jack Swagger & Zeb Colter appear far from appreciative of Alberto Del Rio & Ricardo Rodriguez’s parodying the controversial pair’s YouTube videos. Standing before a wooden shed and wearing wigs and tan vests, Del Rio & Rodriguez mockingly serve up the newest plot against America — delicious Mexican food — much to the chagrin of Swagger & Colter. http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-09/40049901752</p><p>13</p><p>Locking in the ArmbreakerAfter dismantling popular luchador Sin Cara, Jack Swagger refuses to break the Patriot Lock on the masked Superstar, spurring Alberto Del Rio to save his fellow countryman. Seconds after the former Pan-American Games medalist and the NCAA Division I All-American go to the mat, Del Rio deftly cinches in the Cross Armbreaker, but the hold is quickly broken up when Zeb Colter pulls Swagger out of harm’s way. http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-12/40048535533</p><p>14</p><p>Sabotaged by SwaggerWhile rekindling his rivalry with Big Show in a non-title bout on WWE Main Event, Alberto Del Rio again finds his attention torn between his scheduled opponent and the peripheral distraction of Jack Swagger & Zeb Colter, who saunter down to ringside. After The World’s Largest Athlete tosses Del Rio to the outside, Swagger tears into Del Rio’s leg and renders him unable to beat the ref’s count back into the ring.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-14/40048403788</p><p>15</p><p>Ricardo’s ankle snapsAlberto Del Rio returns to winning form with a submission victory over Cody Rhodes but is immediately jumped from behind by Jack Swagger. A pier-six brawl breaks out, but when the World Champion grabs hold of Zeb Colter, it gives a much-needed opening for the “Real American,” who drives Del Rio into the steel steps and the commentary desk. Swagger caps it off with one final offense: breaking Ricardo Rodriguez’s ankle with the Patriot Lock.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-19/40049900265</p><p>16</p><p>Del Rio comes unhingedAlberto Del Rio abandons a contest against U.S. Champion Antonio Cesaro to rescue Ricardo Rodriguez, who is attacked from behind by Jack Swagger at ringside. As the "Real American" drags Ricardo into the crowd and prepares to further damage his already broken ankle, Del Rio leaps onto the ring barrier and lunges at his WrestleMania challenger. The Mexican hero diffuses the situation with a mean thrust kick heard throughout Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-26/40049342770</p><p>17</p><p>Swinging for the fencesFed up with Jack Swagger's bullying, Alberto Del Rio races to ringside when the "Real American" goes after Hornswoggle following Swagger's match against 'Swoggle ally The Great Khali. With baseball's opening day almost upon us, Del Rio takes a page out of the big leaguers' book and swings Ricardo Rodriguez's crutch like a baseball bat. Del Rio deftly locks in the Cross Armbreaker but his limb-wrenching finisher is again broken up by an interfering Zeb Colter.http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-03-30/40049141087</p><p>18</p><p>Swagger leaves a markAlberto Del Rio's supposed one-on-one match against Zeb Colter is revealed to be a ploy drummed up by Colter and protégé Jack Swagger, who breaks up the bout by snapping a steel crutch over Del Rio's body. The propaganda-spewing pair then takes turns brutalizing Del Rio with the crutches, leaving bright red welts on his back. Del Rio later tweets, "Every mark on my body will be a broken bone for you. So start counting #PERROS"http://adelrio.diandian.com/post/2013-04-02/40049756115</p><p>19Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack SwaggerWorld Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio battles for the heart and soul of a country he loves, America, when he takes on top contender and Elimination Chamber Match winner Jack Swagger. As if Del Rio's pride and the World Heavyweight Championship weren't enough reason to bring the fight to the former NCAA All-American athlete, adding fuel to the fire is the retribution Del Rio seeks for the injury suffered by his best friend, Ricardo Rodriguez.</p>
