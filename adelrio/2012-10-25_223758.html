Rey says something in Spanish and then he tells Alberto that he is proud to be a Chicano and an American. Rey says that he has no problem shutting up Alberto’s mouth if Truth doesn’t</p><p><strong>Match Number Three: Rey Mysterio versus Alberto Del Rio in an If it didn’t happen on Raw, it doesn’t matter if this was a feud on Smackdown Match</strong></p><p>Alberto with kicks to Rey but Rey with kicks to Alberto.

Truth kicks Rey since nobody is coming to Rey’s aid.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/58050/wwe-raw-report-where-talking-matters-nexus-matters-non-title-matches-matter-family-matters-movies-matter-revenge-matters-feuds-from-smackdown-matter-truth-matters-do-contracts-matter-choosing-your-words-matters-not-being-a-bully-matters-merchandise-matter-wwwyki-matters-holds-dont-matter-weapons-dont-matter-if-you-use-them-on-john-cena.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/58050/wwe-raw-report-where-talking-matters-nexus-matters-non-title-matches-matter-family-matters-movies-matter-revenge-matters-feuds-from-smackdown-matter-truth-matters-do-contracts-matter-choosing-your-words-matters-not-being-a-bully-matters-merchandise-matter-wwwyki-matters-holds-dont-matter-weapons-dont-matter-if-you-use-them-on-john-cena.html?p=1</a></p>
