Ziggler and Del Rio worked well as a team, while Bryan and Kane kept up their 'fight with each other almost as much as their opponents' gimmick that is nearing the end of its lifespan, I presume. There's only so long that the dysfunctional tag team can 'luck' into victory before it grows tiresome and, here, it seemed more like they simply outlasted Ziggler and Del Rio by hanging on long enough to take advantage of their fatigue. I have no real criticisms about this match. Entertaining from start to finish and I'd be ecstatic to see matches like this every week.</p><p>Rating: 8.5 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/258070/411%5C%5Cs-Instant-Analysis-10.08.12:-WWE-Monday-Night-Raw-.htm">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/258070/411%5C%5Cs-Instant-Analysis-10.08.12:-WWE-Monday-Night-Raw-.htm</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
