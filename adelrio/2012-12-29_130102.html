I went to Elimination Chamber last year in Milwaukee and two Raw shows in Green Bay. I must say, like everyone else has said, the set is unique and brought the show a little more live feel. My sister, my dad, and I got there at about 6:15 pm and got the tickets and we headed straight to our seats. At show time, the arena was 70 percent full, but a solid crowd. Matt Striker came out and introduced the show, proclaiming it would be the most interactive. Then he said there was going to be two special matches. The first, which was next, was a 12 man battle royal.</p><p>1) Alberto Del Rio won a 12-man battle royal to earn an Intercontinental Title shot. It came down to Del Rio and Heath Slater with Drew McIntyre. Ricardo Rodriguez pulled the top rope down and McIntyre flew over after Del Rio whipped him into the rope. Heath was then thrown over the rope to give Del Rio the win and the chance to face Kofi.</p><p>5) Kofi Kingston defeated Wade Barrett and Alberto Del Rio in a Triple Threat to retain the Intercontinental Title. Typical Triple Threat, yet possibly the best match of the night. My dad really got more into the show at this point and was cheering on Del Rio, like most of our row. Lots of signature offense of each of the stars. Del Rio was going for an arm bar and got broke up, and took a Trouble in Paradise. Barrett went for his Bull Hammer shortly after and took the S.O.S. for the win. Very good fun match. Kids love Kofi.</p><p>Notes: Fun show our section was a little rowdy, starting some of the chants. There was one guy pulling off a perfect Ric Rod impression, hilarious. No Rey Mysterio or Sin Cara (given his surgery pending). </p><p>Biggest Pops  1. Sheamus  2. Kofi  3. Del Rio (ironically) </p><p>Most Heat  1. Big Show  2. McGilliguty  3. 3MB</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/267966">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/267966</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From Green Bay, WI (12/27) - Noble Returns, Big Show Vs. Sheamus</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri December 28, 2012</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Jeremy Backman (@jbacks21) for sending in these results from last night's SmackDown live event from the Resch Center in Green Bay, WI:</p><p>Matt Striker was the ring announcer and opened the show. Striker said that there were a bunch of good matches tonight, including a steel cage match, and we were kicking off the evening with a battle royal with the winner facing Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston and Wade Barrett in a triple threat match for the title. The participants were: Michael McGillicutty, Alex Riley, Jinder Mahal, Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre, Tyson Kidd, Justin Gabriel, Primo, Epico, and Alberto Del Rio. Del Rio won the match to get the title shot later tonight.</p><p>Kofi Kingston defeated Wade Barrett and Alberto Del Rio in a triple threat match for the Intercontinental title after Kofi pinned Barrett with the Trouble In Paradise.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1228/559067/big-show/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1228/559067/big-show/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>12/27 SMACKDOWN BRAND RESULTS FROM GREEN BAY, WI</strong></p><p>By Mark Siegel on 2012-12-28 17:19:04</p><p>I saw you were looking for a report. It was very similar to the show the Chicago show, minus the extra main event.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio won the Battle Royal to get a spot in the Triple Threat match where Kofi Kingston defended against him and Wade Barrett.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74288">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74288</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
