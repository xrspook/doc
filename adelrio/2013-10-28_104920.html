Not much happened on the pre-show other than Kofi Kingston beat Damien Sandow. The fans voted Undertaker Mr. Hell In A Cell, by a wide margin. That was pretty much it.</p><p>World Title match time. ADR came out first, John Cena second. Cena got a big cheer at first, then loud boos. The same thing happened when he was introduced by Lilian Garcia. She introduced ADR en Espanol.</p><p>The match started with ADR in control but it didn't take long for Cena to come back. By the way, as mentioned earlier Cena is, smartly, wearing the protective sleeve. They quickly went back to ADR on top. The early story is that "Cena maybe have come back too soon".</p><p>They showed Damien Sandow in the back, watching the match with his briefcase in hand. He can cash in you know! ... Cena made his big comeback and hit a lot of big moves. He went to the top but ADR hit the kick to the head. He set up for second but Cena moved. ADR got a two off of a tilt a whirl backbreaker. ... The story is Cena isn't 100 percent. Cena is selling that the left after isn't 100 percent it seems. ... ADR went to hit Cena in the corner but he moved and ADR missed. Cena hit a cross body from the top. FYI, Cena is using the arm at times, so he is selling. Out of nowhere, Cena locked on the STF. ADR reached for the ropes. He got his fingers on the rope. Break the hold. ADR went on the offensive with kicks and got a two count. ADR locked on the cross arm breaker. Cena locked it out but ADR brock the lock. ADR pulled down the sleeve and Cena went prone for a two count. Cena then did a SICK power out and dumped ADR on his back. AA followed, John Cena is your new World Heavyweight Champion and king of the other house show tour that until now couldn't draw. It will now. Damien ain't coming out folks. They had a good match. I didn't like that ADR got sacrificed but you know how WWE is with Cena.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=81187">http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=81187</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
