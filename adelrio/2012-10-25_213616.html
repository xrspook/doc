What about Brodus? What about the Supplemental Draft?</p><p>We have a new video to accompany the theme song with the new members of the Smackdown roster already added.</p><p>We are live on tape from Greensboro, North Carolina and your announcers are Josh ‘I can do a moonsault’ Mathews, Booker ‘I can do a Spinaroonie’ T, and Michael ‘I can spit my teeth out like chiclets’ Cole.</p><p>The World Title Belt is above the ring because there is a ladder match on Sunday.</p><p>Randy Orton comes to the ring for the first time as a Smackdown superstar since the draft and he is still wearing his brand new blue Smackdown shirt.</p><p>Orton appreciates the ovation and then he introduces himself to the people who might not know him. He tells us that he is Randy Orton in a vintage Orton cadence. For the first time in almost five years, he is back on Smackdown. Randy says that he is looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead, he has to deal with some unfinished business at Extreme Rules with CM Punk.</p><p>Before he can talk about Sunday, he is interrupted by Drew McIntyre in his snazzy Red Raw shirt. He asks if he bought a ticket to see the people in the crowd. Drew points out that Randy Orton is on Smackdown. With the good news comes the bad news for the fans. Drew says that he is moving onwards and upwards to Monday Night Raw. Drew says that it is a shame because the WWE Universe will have to wait a little bit longer for Drew McIntyre versus Randy Orton.</p><p>Drew gets in Randy’s face and the fans want an RKO. Drew says that he can see the look in Randy’s eyes but he is just out here to say hello and goodbye. Drew with a kick and then he sets up for the Future Shock DDT, but Orton escapes and counters with an RKO.</p><p>Orton continues his remarks about CM Punk, but he is interrupted this time by Alex Riley in his brand new Smackdown shirt. Riley is about to make his first remarks as a member of the Smackdown roster, but Orton does not have time to listen to Alex Riley and he gives Riley an RKO.</p><p>Orton looks like he is enjoying his time on Smackdown and he figures he will try to talk again about Extreme Rules, but he is stopped by Alberto Del Rio who walks out with Ricardo Rodriguez and Brodus Clay.</p><p>Alberto reminds who he is, but we already know that, especially Randall. Alberto says that he sees that Randy is making a great first impression, just like Alberto did on his first night on Smackdown. Alberto says that he feels bad for the people on Smackdown because they are losing him. After Sunday at Extreme Rules, they are going to lose the World Heavyweight Title because he is going to take it with him to Raw. Alberto tells Randall that he knows how to make a great first impression, but he knows how to make a lasting one.</p><p>Alberto, Brodus, and Ricardo enter the ring and surround Orton. Christian comes to the ring to help Randy.</p><p>Teddy Long’s music plays and he comes out. He tells the playas in the ring to wait. He says that it might be a new era on Smackdown, but we are going to play by his rules. Teddy tells the playas that the main event tonight will be a tag match. Alberto Del Rio and Brodus Clay will face Christian and Randy Orton.</p><p>Alberto winks at Orton and then gets out of the ring before Orton can do anything to him. Clay gets sent to the floor by a Christian drop kick.</p><p>Christian is in the locker room and Matt Striker is there to ask him about his match with Alberto Del Rio at Extreme Rules. Christian says that he wants to take us back a little. He says that Alberto Del Rio talks about destiny. Christian talks about his destiny when Alberto caused Christian to tear his pectoral muscle and it gave him time to think. What if that was it and his career was over. Now we go to the present where his best friend of 27 years Edge is on the biggest stage of them all defending his title and then he has to retire. Christian wonders if he is just in the right place at the right time or is it time to fill his potential. Christian says that until last week, he never put his hands on the title belt because he never felt that he earned that right. Sunday is his destiny when he will climb the ladder and he will achieve his destiny and win the World Title.</p><p>It is time to run through the card for Extreme Rules.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Did You Know that Smackdown has been the most watched show on Syfy for thirty consecutive weeks.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: Alberto Del Rio and Brodus Clay with Ricardo Rodriguez versus Christian and Randy Orton</strong></p><p>Del Rio and Christian appear to start things off but Alberto tags in Clay.
