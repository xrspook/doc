He says that he never lost hope. Now it feels good to be back with all of his friends, family, and his people in his home town to officially say that he is back.</p><p>He couldn’t wait so he came back on Raw. Because Alberto Del Rio was in the ring, it made things sweeter. He says that he has to admit . . .</p><p>Alberto Del Rio’s music interrupts Rey and Alberto comes out dressed quite dapper with Ricardo Rodriguez. Alberto welcomes back the Chihuahua. He tells Rey that he made a mistake coming back because he never should have picked a fight against him. The people might not remember, but Rey remembers that Alberto took him out a year ago and almost ended his career.</p><p>Alberto makes it to the ring and he says that he could finish the job right now. Alberto gives Rey an order instead. He tells Rey to leave his ring right now.</p><p>Rey says that he ain’t going nowhere.</p><p>Alberto says that he has everything. He has the money, the power, and the titles. Alberto wants to talk about what Sheamus did at Money in the Bank.</p><p>Rey tells Alberto that Sheamus beat Alberto’s face in at Money in the Bank.</p><p>Alberto tells Rey that he hasn’t learned anything, but Rey’s return will be short. Lucky for Rey, the one who will destroy Rey’s life and career is none other than the next World Champion Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>That brings out Dolph Ziggler, Vickie Guerrero, and their love child known as the Money in the Bank briefcase. Dolph says that if the next World Champion is going to ruin Rey’s career, it will be due to him. Dolph tells Rey it is his lucky day because he isn’t out here for Rey. He is out here for Alberto.</p><p>Dolph mentions that he defeated seven other people to win the briefcase and earn the title match. He was going to cash it in on Sunday but due to Alberto, he is not the champion.</p><p>Alberto says that he does not work for Dolph and he will not do the dirty job for Dolph to help him out. Alberto says that Dolph could be working for him along with his burra.</p><p>Rey wants to bring the discussion back and he tells Dolph and Alberto if the ladies want to settle things, they should shut up and take care of each other.</p><p>Dolph agrees with Rey but he says that they shouldn’t deal with each other.</p><p>Before Alberto or Dolph can do anything to Rey, Sheamus’ music plays and they forget that he has to walk to the ring so they stop their attempt to attack Rey.</p><p>Sheamus tells Rey that it is so good to see him, fella. Sheamus tells Dolph if he makes another step, he will send him into the Pacific Ocean. Sheamus suggests they do something right now.</p><p>Dolph is ready for a fight, but Alberto leaves the ring. Sheamus with a running double sledge and Dolph falls into the ropes. Since Rey did not send him into the ropes, Dolph is not stuck in the ropes. Dolph is able to avoid the 619 and he goes to the floor and leaves.</p><p>We are back and the tag match has been made with Sheamus and Rey Mysterio facing Dolph Ziggler and Alberto Del Rio. </p><p>We go to the back and Vickie yells at Ricardo for Alberto calling her a burro.
