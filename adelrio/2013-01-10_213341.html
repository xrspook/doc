A novel idea, Clearwire Corporation, which provides mobile and fixed wireless broadband communications services, set-up a table where fans could make signs. Clearwire provided the cardboard and markers. Fans provided the knowledge.</p><p>Maybe fans forgot, did not have time or did not have the materials to sign. This idea allowed them to join the fun. So many of those who entered the arena sign-less were sign-more.</p><p>One fan said, ‘Maybe now I’ll be on TV,” as WWE TV cameras scan the crowd for emotion and signage.</p><p>It was a hit.</p><p>The show also a hit with the return of Miami’s The Rock to SmackDown after a 10-year absence.</p><p>The Rock acknowledged Miami (Carol City’s own) Flo Rida seated front row on the announce table side. Flo Rida, along with his associates, enjoyed the action. Flo Rida sang “Wild Ones” and “Good Feeling” live during The Rock’s entrance for the main event of WrestleMania 28 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens.</p><p>The Rock also praised his alma mater the University of Miami, making his own hand sign, symbolizing The U as did fans. He had a funny segment with Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow), especially mocking Rhodes’ pencil mustache.</p><p><strong>The hometown crowd cheered another exciting moment later in the show when South Florida’s Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) defeated the Big Show, also living in South Florida, in a Last Man Standing match for the World title. Del Rio celebrated by going into the South Florida crowd.</strong></p><p><strong>Del Rio is a former WWE champ, Royal Rumble winner and Money in the Bank winner.</strong></p><p>• Twitter: @VivaDelRio</p><p>• WWE SmackDown is 8 p.m. Fridays on Syfy.</p><p>• WWE RAW celebrates its 20th anniversary live on the USA Network beginning at 8 p.m. EST Monday, Jan. 14 from the Toyota Center in Houston.</p><p>Who will return for RAW 20?</p><p>RAW has been on the air longer than shows like ER, Dallas, Law & Order, Cheers and Seinfeld.</p><p>The WWE Royal Rumble is live 8 p.m. EST on pay-per-view on Sunday, Jan. 27. The Rock will be in the main event against the WWE champ. The Royla Rumble is the kick off to the Road to WrestleMania 29, which is April 7 from MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/10/3175708/wwe-fans-canvas-arena-with-signs.html">http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/10/3175708/wwe-fans-canvas-arena-with-signs.html</a></p></p><p>South Florrida's Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez celebrate with the hometown crowd after Del Rio beat the Big Show in a Last Man Standing match for the World title during the WWE SmackDown TV tapings at the AmericanAirlines Arena, home of the NBA champion Miami Heat.
