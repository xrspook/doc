Our announce team is Michael Cole, JBL and Jerry Lawler. I hope we get the good version of JBL. ... The show is opening up with the World Heavyweight Title match. Hmm, that plays into the "Dolph Ziggler will cash in his MITB briefcase at the end of this match" theory. If he does get jobbed out of the title, will he somehow find his way into the Chamber match later?<br></p><p>Early on, they are going back and forth. Alberto has the fans doing the "Si" chant. It would be cool if WWE could get them to do the "Ole" chant you hear at other sporting events. Anyway, point is that the fans are into ADR. By the time I finished typing that, Show has taken control.</p><p>Show gets a two after a splash from the second row. He totally protected him, which ADR no doubt appreciates. ... ADR locks on his submission, but Show makes it to the ropes and has ADR in a bearhug for a while. Show went for a power bomb but ADR turned it into a rana! He then blasted Show out on the floor. Show managed to get back into the ring at 9! ADR hits a senton but only gets a two.<br></p><p>Show comes back with a chokeslam but ADR kicks out at two. The fans pop big time. Show loaded up for the big punch but ADR rolled out of the right. He somehow managed to hit a DDT but only got two. If Ziggler is going to cash in, they have to have ADR win and then Show decimate him. ... ADR hit the big kick for another two.</p><p>ADR locks in the armbreaker in the middle of the ring. Show is trying to break it. And he does, but standing up and dumping ADR on his back. It's hard to beat giant strength! ... Giant was going to Punch ADR when Ricardo got on the ring. Show trashed him. ADR used this to tru for the enzigiri but slipped and missed. He immediately did it again, which made it OK. Then he killed Show with another one and locked on the armbreaker in the middle of the ring. He still hasn't pinned Show but he made his ass tap! Really good opener. ADR has been great since turning. Now, will we see Dolph?</p><p>ADR is preening to the crowd. Show rolled out of the ring. Looks like ADR is safe and going to WrestleMania! If this holds, it is totally the right call. ADR is getting over as a face champ. It would be stupid to stunt his momentum.</p><p>On a side note, thanks to everyone that told me I had the wrong title on this sucker!<br></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75493/live-ongoing-elimination-chamber-blog.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75493/live-ongoing-elimination-chamber-blog.html?p=1</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411’s WWE Elimination Chamber Report 02.17.13</strong></p><p>Posted by Scott Slimmer on 02.17.2013</p><p>We are LIVE in beautiful New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><p>World Heavyweight Championship Match</p><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio (Champion) w/ Ricardo Rodriguez vs. The Big Show</strong></p><p>Show immediately traps Del Rio in the corner and goes for a big chop, but Del Rio evades and connects with a kick to the gut.
