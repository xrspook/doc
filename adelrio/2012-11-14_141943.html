"You're at a point where he basically died... It was definitely a scary moment."</strong></p><p>Del Rio commented on the impact that CM Punk's nearly year-long title reign has had on WWE, stating, "Punk is an excellent wrestler and an excellent performer and I think he's doing a great job."</p><p>They were also asked if Linda McMahon losing the Senate race for the second time may have an impact on possibly bringing back programming more like the Attitude Era.</p><p><strong>"To be honest with you, no, because we don't decide that," admitted Del Rio. "The company must do whatever is best for the company and the fans."</strong></p><p><strong>Del Rio also talked about being a heel and never wanting to be a babyface, saying, "This is what I love to do. I'm just having the best time of my life being a heel. I want to be a heel for the rest of my career but I'm not sure if that's possible."</strong></p><p>Other items discussed include The Rock demanding a title shot at Royal Rumble, Ricardo finding it difficult to transition from a luchador to a ring announcer and Del Rio's thoughts on taking on the Undertaker's streak.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1113/557911/alberto-del-rio/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1113/557911/alberto-del-rio/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>NoDQ.com WWE Del Rio & Rodriguez Talk Punk's Title Reign, More Posted by Steve Carrier on 11/13/2012 at 06:14 PM</strong></p><p>Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez were interviewed earlier today by Chris Van Vliet.
