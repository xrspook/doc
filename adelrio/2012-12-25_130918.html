He is knocked out of the way and an animated John Cena comes to save the day and he lights the tree and we see Santa in the background.</p><p>Raw is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and your announcers are Jerry ‘Will anyone mind if I wear a Browns jersey’ Lawler and Michael ‘The Fish that Saved Pittsburgh’ Cole.</p><p>Our host makes his way to the ring and it is Santa Claus.

He says that he is the only Harvard educated lawyer in the history of the WWE. That makes him uniquely qualified to discuss the situation involving Santa and Alberto Del Rio. People are quick to pass judgment and assign blame. He says that people are pre judging and they are prejudiced. David says that Alberto is really the victim. Santa is guilty of trespassing and working without the proper visas.</p><p>Zack Ryder says that Alberto ran over Santa. The man who says ho ho ho is in the back getting treatment while Otunga faces the man who says woo woo woo.</p><p>Michael Cole reminds us that Santa suffered some injuries as a result of colliding with Alberto Del Rio’s hood.</p><p>In case you missed it the first four or five times, we see the horrible automobile accident involving Santa Claus and Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>We go to Matt Striker for the latest update on Santa. Matt says that Santa has taken a turn for the worst and he is about to be taken to a medical facility but it looks like he is doing much better. It is a Christmas Eve Miracle.</p><p>Ricardo comes out and he cannot do the usual Alberto introduction because of what happened earlier to Santa.</p><p><strong>Match Number Nine: John Cena versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Miracle on 34th . . .
