That’s really not as bad as it sounds if you live here. If you’re Layla and from Miami, it’s probably a significant emotional event.</strong></p><p>Tony Chimel opened up the evening’s festivities at the Carlson Center at about 7:32pm with a welcome and the playing of the National Anthem. He then announced the text/Twitter voting for the stipulation of the main event: best 2 of 3 falls or no-DQ…You know which way the vote will go already. I voted for 2 of 3 falls.</p><p>I’ve seen more people in here for a UAF hockey game than there are for this Smackdown World Tour house show. The crowd is a mix of old school guys like me who have followed forever and kids in the know with their clueless parents. If there are over 2000 people here, I’d be amazed. Sad since I’ve been to regional promotion events in much smaller locales that had higher attendance.</p><p>Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio w/Ricardo Rodriguez. Big Show came out to a very good response. Crowd doesn’t care the Show is supposed to be the heel and ADR the face, especially since 10-15% of the crowd had left by this point. Once both men are in the ring, Tony announced this will be a no-DQ match (receiving 61% of the vote). Not a bad match, but both men looked tired working. ADR tried to put Show up on his shoulders, but collapsed under the weight which got a good cheer from the crowd. Show brought out a chair, which ADR quickly got rid of. ADR worked Big Show onto the floor and positioned a table into the corner, Show worked himself into the ring, but also worked himself through the table. Finally, Show brought his own table into the ring, set it up, placed ADR on it and went to the top rope. ADR moved out of the way, Show crashed through the table and Del Rio got the pin. Despite the roles of the men, ADR and RR quickly exited and Big Show got a big response from the crowd as he got up and exited the ring. Just as he was to go through the curtains backstage, he turned and gave the crowd a huge wave which garnered a nice response from the Fairbanks faithful.</p><p>Tony Chimel thanked the crowd and the lights came back up.</p><p>Overall this was a good show with some very high points but a couple of matches with wrestlers who need some work. The Carlson Center staff had zero crowd control which was annoying at times. There was no need to buy a floor seat ticket when you could just jump the rail with no consequence. My boys really had a great time, each leaving with a new t-shirt, a program, and one of the signed portraits being offered at the merchandise booth (they had Sheamus and Randy Orton signed photos). Good night of wrestling.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74813">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74813</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
