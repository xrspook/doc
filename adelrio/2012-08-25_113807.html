What will happen tonight when Booker T addresses the situation on tonight’s show?</p><p>We are live on tape from Bakersfield, California and your announcers is Michael ‘Great, I get to break in a new announcer because Kane went crazy on Sunday’ Cole.</p><p>Randy Orton makes his way to the ring and he will have something to say to the people of Bakersfield. We see what happened on Monday night when Randy Orton got the win because of Sheamus’ involvement from ringside.</p><p>Randy tells us who he is. He says that he has never been a glass half full person. He likes to take the glass, smash it into a million pieces and then beat up the person who came up with the term. Randy says that he thrives on confrontation.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio says that he should mind his own business and that Randy’s win on Monday was tainted. Orton says that is too bad. He says that he deserves to face Sheamus for the World Championship.</p><p>Judging on how the internet and social media blew up based on what happened, he is sure that there are a few people who have a problem with what he is saying. Randy invites those people to come out to the ring right now and confront him.</p><p>Orton waits for a moment and the first person to accept the Randy Orton verbal challenge is the World Champion Sheamus and he is ready to talk. . . fella.</p><p>Sheamus tells Randy that he is not out here to disagree with him.

Alberto tells Booker that Sheamus is a cheater and Orton is a crazy animal. Are those the type of people you want for the World Title?</p><p>Booker starts to speak and Alberto cuts him off. Alberto says that he should have been the World Champion by now because everyone knows that Sheamus cheated. The referee robbed him at SummerSlam. Then the next night, he was put in a match against Randy Orton and the only reason why Orton won because Sheamus cheated again.</p><p>Booker starts to talk and Alberto cuts him off again and he says that Booker doesn’t know anything. He wants to know if Booker is aware that Sheamus is a cheater and a thief.</p><p>Alberto says that he never lost the match because he was in control and he was destroying Sheamus. Alberto reminds Booker of the protest he filed and he says that he is waiting for an answer.</p><p>Randy says that Alberto is embarrassing himself.</p><p>Alberto says that there is a conspiracy and Booker is a cheater and criminal just like Sheamus. Alberto says that Booker, Sheamus, Orton, and everyone is against him.</p><p>Booker tells Alberto to calm down. Booker tells Randy that he will always be in line for a title shot, but the person who was in line next is Alberto Del Rio. That was until Alberto came out and ran his mouth. Booker says that he changed his mind. Tonight we will have a rematch from Raw between Alberto and Randy. The winner of the match will be the number one contender for the World Title.</p><p>Booker wants to know if we can dig that.</p><p>We go the back and Alberto is yelling at Ricardo and we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Sheamus has joined Michael at the announce table.</p><p>Match Number Six: Randy Orton versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Number One Contender Match</p><p>They lock up and Del Rio with a side head lock and shoulder tackle for a near fall.
