They came straight to the ring. Ricardo was wearing a neck brace. Del Rio spoke and received the "What?" treatment. They aired a montage of Brogue Kicks with the goal of having it banned. Booker T came out and asked the fans whether he should ban the kick. The fans were against it, so the kick is still legal.</p><p>Sheamus defeated David Otunga. They changed the ring apron beforehand. Alberto came out to watch the match. Sheamus hit White Noise to set up the Brogue Kick. Booker came out and interrupted the match. He banned the Brogue Kick. Sheamus jaw jacked with Del Rio at ringside, then caught Otunga with the Irish Curse and finished him off with the Cloverleaf.</p><p>Dark Main Event</p><p>Randy Orton defeated Alberto Del Rio in a No Holds Barred match. ADR uses the kendo stick. Orton got it and beat Del Rio with it. He clotheslined Del Rio twice, power slammed him, and performed the DDT off the middle rope. Orton went for the RKO, but Del Rio countered with a Backstabber. Orton came back with the RKO and got the win.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/253597">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/253597</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SPOILERSWWE SmackDown Results For This Friday</strong></p><p>By Marc Middleton | September 04, 2012</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com readers Terrence Link and Bradley for sending in these results from tonight's SmackDown tapings in Mobile, IL:</p><p>SmackDown opens with Alberto Del Rio and David Otunga coming out.
