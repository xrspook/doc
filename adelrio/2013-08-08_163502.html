Hailing from a wealthy family, Del Rio has a haughty air about him and a demeanor that tends to be off-putting to the WWE Universe.</p><p>During summer 2010, Del Rio debuted in WWE, making an immediate impact on SmackDown by interrupting and insulting the 619’s own Rey Mysterio. Later that night, Del Rio backed up his bluster by making the former World Champion tap out to his signature Cross Armbreaker. Del Rio quickly followed up on his early success by winning several high-profile matches, including 2011’s 40-Man Royal Rumble Match and WWE Money in the Bank’s Raw Ladder Match that July. These triumphs were key in helping Del Rio fulfill his “destiny” at 2011’s SummerSlam, where he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat CM Punk and become the first-ever Mexican-born WWE Champion.</p><p>In October 2011, Alberto Del Rio captured championship gold a second time, in a Triple Threat Match against CM Punk and John Cena at WWE Hell in a Cell. In April 2012, Del Rio officially became a SmackDown Superstar. Day by day, the Mexican Superstar is proving that his unbounded talent, pride and aggression are more than just a formula for winning inside the ring, but the very “Essence of Excellence” in WWE.</p><p>Del Rio’s quest to capture the World Title ran through Night of Champions, where he faced World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus. Heading into the pay-per-view, Del Rio built up a great deal of momentum, even playing an intricate role in SmackDown General Manager Booker T’s banning of Sheamus’ signature Brogue Kick. It seemed that the affluent Superstar’s destiny would be fulfilled, but Booker T reinstated the maneuver before the contest at Night of Champions, and Del Rio ultimately fell to the bottom of Sheamus’ boot.</p><p>For Del Rio’s next target, he set his sights on Randy Orton, attacking The Viper before a No. 1 Contender’s Match. The attack kept Orton from winning that contest, but Del Rio wasn’t done. He unleashed a wave of assaults against Orton, mocking The Viper’s signature poses and christening himself as the “new Apex Predator of WWE.” At Hell in a Cell, however, Del Rio's attempt to supplant the pecking order fell short when Orton defeated him with his signature RKO.</p><p>Just more than a month later at WWE TLC, Del Rio found himself in strange company, teaming with The Miz & The Brooklyn Brawler to challenge and defeat bullies-turned bandmates 3MB.</p><p>Then, on the Jan. 8 SmackDown taping, Del Rio finally fulfilled his World Title destiny, defeating Big Show in an epic Last Man Standing Match to claim the World Heavyweight Championship. The new champion was victorious once again in a rematch at the Royal Rumble with identical stipulations, and he made the challenger tap out in another encounter at Elimination Chamber.</p><p>Del Rio's next challenge came from Jack Swagger. The self-proclaimed "Real American," along with his xenophobic associate Zeb Colter, felt that Del Rio's Mexican heritage was part of the reason that the America they once knew was fading away. The two met at WrestleMania 29 with the World Heavyweight Title on the line. Though he found himself trapped in Swagger's Patriot Lock, Del Rio fought his way out, eventually forcing his challenger to tap out to the Cross Armbreaker.</p><p>The following night on Raw, Del Rio won his match against Jack Swagger, but was injured during the bout. Taking full advantage of the champion's weakened knee, Mr. Money in the Bank, Dolph Ziggler, decided to cash in. The combination of an amped-up Showoff and an aching knee was too much for Del Rio to overcome, and Ziggler claimed the World Title.</p><p>The Mexican Superstar got vicious when it came time to reclaim the title at WWE Payback. Taking malicious advantage of the fact that Ziggler was out for an extended period of time due to a concussion, Del Rio repeatedly targeted The Showoff’s head. When ringside doctors attempted to aid a clearly injured Ziggler, Del Rio continued his assault, capping things off with a brutal knockout mule kick to lay Dolph out for good en route to reclaiming the World Heavyweight Title.</p><p>In the following weeks, the rivalry between Del Rio and Ziggler ramped up, as the former titleholder crashed Del Rio's fiesta on SmackDown and smashed a guitar over Ricardo Rodriguez's head. Del Rio held onto his title against The Showoff at Money in the Bank when the unpredictable AJ Lee injected herself into the match and blasted the Mexican Superstar with her Divas Title, drawing a Disqualification in the champion’s favor.</p><p>Del Rio was soon given the opportunity to choose his SummerSlam opponent, but when SmackDown GM Vickie Guerrero didn't like the champion's choice of Ricardo Rodriguez, a Triple Threat Match commenced to determine the No. 1 contender. Christian emerged victorious, and now Captain Charisma will battle Del Rio for the World Title at The Biggest Party of the Summer. Before that bout, however, the champion had a sickening surprise for the WWE Universe. After losing to RVD on the Aug. 5 Raw, Del Rio shockingly took out his frustrations on Ricardo Rodriguez, decimating his former friend in a brutal and hard-to-stomach post-match assault.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/superstars/albertodelrio">http://www.wwe.com/superstars/albertodelrio</a></p></p><p>截图自北京时间2013-08-08 16:10</p><p>My Name … is Alberto Del Rio!June 25, 2010Did you know that you’re not as smart as Alberto Del Rio? Or as rich? Or as skilled, brave and pious? Thanks to two long-winded weeks’ worth of introductory videos, the WWE Universe is made well aware of the arrogant Mexican Aristocrat’s stance on them, and his intentions in WWE. According to Del Rio, speaking in a tone reminiscent of the Dos Equis guy, capturing WWE gold is his “destiny.”  </p><p>The Debut of DestinyAugust 20, 2010With more hype behind his debut than the egg at the 1990 Survivor Series, Del Rio sets high expectations. And he delivers. Porting his own personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, and kicking off a tradition of driving to the ring in a different luxury automobile each week, Del Rio silences critics by making two-time World Heavyweight Champion Rey Mysterio tap out to his innovative cross armbreaker submission. </p><p>Del Rio Rules RumbleJanuary 30, 2011After less than one year in WWE, Alberto Del Rio accomplishes what eludes many Superstars over the course of an entire career – he wins the Royal Rumble. And, true to his larger-than-life bravado, Del Rio wins the largest Rumble in history, outlasting 39 other Superstars to win a World Championship Match at WrestleMania XXVII. </p><p>WrestleMania Main EventApril 3, 2011Alberto Del Rio’s first WrestleMania appearance is a main event championship match. Despite the loss to World Heavyweight Champion, Edge, Del Rio proves that he belongs in the main event picture. </p><p>Del Rio Is DineroJuly 17, 2011Again, facing odds capable of making a less assured Superstar buckle, Del Rio shines by clamoring atop seven other Superstars to win Raw’s Money in the Bank Ladder Match, and a guaranteed WWE Championship title opportunity. </p><p>Destiny DefinedAugust 14, 2011After CM Punk defeats John Cena to become the Undisputed WWE Champion, the shocking return of Kevin Nash leaves The Straight Edge Superstar in a heap of mid-ring unconsciousness. Enter the Mexican millionaire, who wastes no time cashing in his Money in the Bank title opportunity and fulfilling his destiny by capturing the WWE Championship. </p><p>Del Rio Conquers HellOctober 2, 2011One month after losing the WWE Championship to John Cena at Vengeance, Del Rio’s rematch takes place inside Hell in a Cell, with the added element of CM Punk thrown into the triple threat mix. Just like his first Royal Rumble, and first Money in the Bank match earlier in the year, Del Rio seals his first Cell triumph with a decisive victory, and nets his second WWE Title. </p><p>Last Man StandingJanuary 8, 2013Determined to stand up to the bullying Big Show in Miami, Del Rio challenges The World’s Largest Athlete for the World Heavyweight Championship in a Last Man Standing Match mandated by SmackDown General Manager Booker T. The Latino hero shockingly grounds the champion to win the title and has a repeat performance two weeks later at the Royal Rumble.</p><p>Getting PaybackJune 16, 2013The Mexican Superstar got vicious when it came time to reclaim the World Title at WWE Payback. Taking advantage of the fact that Dolph Ziggler was out for an extended period of time due to a concussion, Del Rio repeatedly targeted The Showoff’s head. Del Rio continued his assault, capping things off with a brutal knockout mule kick to lay Dolph out for good en route to reclaiming the World Heavyweight Title.</p>
