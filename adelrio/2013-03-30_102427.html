Since this is the last full episode of Smackdown, will they send us into the final ‘important’ show before Wrestlemania with anticipation for the Showcase of the Immortals or will they be clamoring to see the live coverage of the pay per view on this site since they have lost interest?</p><p>We are in Hershey, Pennsylvania and your announcers are Michael ‘Shouldn’t this show feature Mark Henry since we are in Chocolate Town USA’ Cole, Josh ‘The river is made of chocolate’ Mathews and John ‘I would climb a mountain of chocolate’ Layfield.</p><p><strong>Match Number Three:Great Khali (with Hornswoggle and Natalya) versus Jack Swagger (with Zeb Colter)</strong></p><p>They lock up and Khali pushes Swagger to the mat. They lock up again and Khali backs Swagger into the corner and he tries to chop Swagger but he takes too long and Swagger gets out of the corner and he connects with shoulders. Khali with a clothesline and then he sends Swagger into the corner.</p><p>Khali with a chop to the chest and then he sends Swagger into a different corner for another chop. Khali grabs Swagger by the throat but Swagger escapes and he kicks Khali and connects with shoulders in the corner. Khali pushes Swagger out of the corner. Khali with an elbow and a kick. Khali with two clotheslines. Khali sets for the chop to the head but Swagger gets to the floor.</p><p>Khali’s leg is dropped on the top rope and then Swagger with a running shoulder to the groin. Khali falls to the floor and then he tries for the ankle lock but Khali kicks Swagger away a few times.</p><p>Swagger applies the ankle lock and the referee gets to ten and both men are counted out.</p><p>Double Count Out</p><p>After the match, Swagger refuses to release the hold and Hornswoggle grabs Swagger. Colter and Swagger surround Hornswoggle and Swagger sends Hornswoggle into the ringside barrier.</p><p>Colter tells Swagger to break the leg, but Ricardo Rodriguez makes his way to the stage. He wants to know who Swagger is dealing with. He tells Swagger to come after him a third time. Swagger stands in the ring and his back is to the announce table while Ricardo limps to the ring. Del Rio appears behind Swagger and Del Rio attacks Swagger and Del Rio puts Swagger in the cross arm breaker. Colter breaks up the hold but Ricardo hits Colter with the crutch. Ricardo tosses the crutch to Del Rio but he cannot connect with Swagger who gets to the floor and he goes up the ramp with Colter.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/76495/wwe-smackdown-report-people-power-versus-peoples-elbow-are-the-shield-finally-at-a-disadvantage-does-it-feel-like-wrestlemania-season-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/76495/wwe-smackdown-report-people-power-versus-peoples-elbow-are-the-shield-finally-at-a-disadvantage-does-it-feel-like-wrestlemania-season-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
