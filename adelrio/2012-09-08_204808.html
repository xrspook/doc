Earlier this week, Otunga had Touted that they would be taking legal action against World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus for the incident.</p><p>Coming off huge victories against the likes of Randy Orton, Kane and John Cena in recent weeks, Del Rio told the SmackDown crowd that he’s "on the greatest roll of his career." Even so, the No. 1 contender to Sheamus’ World Heavyweight Title said that The Great White will have an unfair advantage at Night of Champions – comparing Sheamus’ Brogue Kick to being able to use a steel chair.</p><p>Stating that the move represents a "criminal act" that is both "brutal" and "barbaric," Del Rio went so far as to call for a ban on The Great White’s finishing maneuver. Otunga agreed, giving his opinion that Sheamus' attack was no accident and describing a meeting with SmackDown General Manager Booker T in which they had demanded compensation, justice and the outlawing of the Brogue Kick.</p><p>A livid Booker arrived on the scene, disturbed that Del Rio and company had chosen to take their argument before the WWE Universe instead of keeping it private. Therefore, the five-time WCW Champion decided to follow suit, asking the fans if the Brouge Kick should be banned. When they responded with overwhelming disapproval, he opted to comply with their opinion.</p><p>Kane was fined an undisclosed amount for his attacks on Josh Mathews Following two different onslaughts at the hands of Kane recently, SmackDown announcer Josh Mathews informed Michael Cole that Booker T had fined The Big Red Monster an undisclosed amount of money as punishment. As a result, Mathews said he was ready to move on.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-07/results-26049956">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-07/results-26049956</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus def. David Otunga</strong></p><p> David Otunga, legal counsel to Ricardo Rodriguez and the Superstar who led the crusade to ban the Brogue Kick throughout the night, suddenly found himself facing off against World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus in a SmackDown main event made by General Manager Booker T.</p><p>It was a showdown that pitted power against power from the start. In the culmination of the hard-fought match, with Alberto Del Rio looking on from ringside, The Great White took control and connected with a thundering White Noise. Sheamus then called for the Brogue Kick, but instead, the titleholder was interrupted by Booker T, who floored the WWE Universe with a major announcement.</p><p>In a shocking move, the hesitant GM reversed course on his previous decision, and reluctantly banned the Brogue Kick!</p><p>The Moline members of the WWE Universe immediately expressed their outrage, right along with Sheamus. Del Rio, on the other hand, loved the decision, and left the arena with a big smile on his face.</p><p>Never one to be discouraged, though, The Celtic Warrior used another tactic to defeat Otunga. After planting the Harvard-educated lawyer with a devastating Irish Curse, The Celtic Warrior locked in the Cloverleaf, a submission maneuver Sheamus introduced to his repertoire Monday on Raw. Otunga had no choice but to tap out, and Sheamus walked away with another resounding Friday night win.</p><p>Sheamus remains the most dominant force on SmackDown, but what does the banning of the Brogue Kick mean for The Great White’s chances when he faces Del Rio at Night of Champions with the title on the line?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-07/results-26049956/page-7">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-09-07/results-26049956/page-7</a></p>
