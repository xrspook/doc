What will happen when they bring talkies to us in a moment?</p><p>We are live from San Diego, California and your announcers are Michael ‘Simon and Simon’ Cole, Jerry ‘Coleman’ Lawler, and Jim ‘BBQ Tacos’ Ross.</p><p>What better person to deal with the WWE Title picture than the man who started things rolling with his missed call of John Cena’s foot on the rope, the WWE COO Triple H. He says that there are some people who are upset with what happened last night.</p><p>Hunter says that he wants to apologize to the WWE Universe and to John Cena. Hunter says that he made a mistake. He says that he watched the footage and John Cena’s foot was on the bottom rope. Hunter says that he is going to tell Cena that he is sorry when he meets Cena face to face. Hunter says that they had a hell of a match and if he didn’t screw it up, he didn’t know who would win. Hunter says that he had no trouble raising the hand of the new Undisputed WWE Champion CM Punk.</p><p>As for what happened after the match, a lot of people are speculating about his involvement. Hunter says that he had nothing to do with it. He says that he is friends with Kevin Nash. He said that Nash called him for a few tickets to SummerSlam. He did not know that Nash was going to jump the rail and attack CM Punk. Hunter says that he invited Kevin Nash to come tonight to explain himself. As long as he could tell the truth, Nash will be here.</p><p>As far as Alberto Del Rio cashing in Money in the Bank, he did not know anything about that. That is just the way that Money in the Bank works. Hunter says that he promised when SummerSlam was over and they came to San Diego, there would no longer be two champions and there would be only one Undisputed WWE Champion. Hunter brings out that man.</p><p>Alberto makes his way to the ring, at least we think it is him because Ricardo did not introduce him. Alberto tells us who he is, but we already knew that and he says that he is the Undisputed WWE Champion. Alberto says that he has been saying for weeks and weeks that it was his destiny to become WWE Champion. Alberto says that he is going to be honest for everyone because he loves them.</p><p>It was not his intention to cash in his money in the bank at SummerSlam. Destiny do whatever he wants. After what Kevin Nash did, he couldn’t resist. Some people just are born to be great. Alberto says that he is the greatest of the great. The Undisputed WWE Champion.</p><p>Alberto says that as their champion, he wants to represent everyone with respect, honesty, and passion. He just wants to be their champion. Alberto says that he will be in the lobby signing autographs for everyone. He will take pictures with everyone’s kids. That is the kind of champion he wants to be. A champion for his people. Tonight, for his first title defense, he is going to face the former WWE Champion Rey Mysterio. He says that we should cheer Rey because when he was told that his first title defense was going to be against Rey. Everyone loves Rey Mysterio. Alberto says that Rey is a Mexican icon, a gran luchador.</p><p>He says that he loves Rey Mysterio. He says that he loves Rey and he loves beating Rey Mysterio. He started his WWE career defeating Rey Mysterio. Every time he wakes up in the morning, he thinks what will he do today. He says that he feels like beating Rey Mysterio today. That is exactly what he is going to do tonight in San Diego.</p><p>He tells everyone to change their area code because they will have a new hero. A true hero, Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>Nash wants to know if Punk wants to see the text message on his phone and Punk asks Nash if he wants to see a text from Punk’s sister and it wondered if Nash was dead. Punk says that Nash’s career is dead. Punk says that he is pissed off last night. Punk says that he is pissed at a lot of people, but Alberto Del Rio is not one of those people. Nash is a sign of what it is like to have Triple H in control. He is bringing back his cronies.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez versus Rey Mysterio for the WWE Championship</strong></p><p>Del Rio with a waist lock but Rey with an elbow and a standing switch. Rey with a drop kick for a near fall. Rey with another rollup but Del Rio with a kick to the midsection followed by more kicks. Del Rio with an Irish whip but Rey with a head scissors and guess where Del Rio went. Del Rio is able to go to the floor because it is too soon for the 619. We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Del Rio tries to take off Rey’s mask like he did at Money in the Bank. We see highlights of what Del Rio did to Rey when he dropped Rey on the ringside barrier. Rey with a drop toe hold into the corner and then Rey with a hobbling drop kick into the corner. Rey goes up top and Del Rio stops Rey.</p><p>Del Rio with more punches and then Del Rio climbs the turnbuckles but Rey kicks Del Rio and hits a tornado DDT and both men are down. Rey with a springboard cross body for a near fall. Rey with a rollup for a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the head to stop Rey’s offense. Del Rio with a near fall and then he applies a waist lock on Rey and then he turns it into a body scissors.</p><p>Rey with a kick but Del Rio with a head butt. Del Rio misses a drop kick against the ropes and Del Rio goes to the floor. Rey with a baseball slide to Del Rio. Rey with an Asai Moonsault onto Del Rio and both men are down on the floor. Rey sends Del Rio back into the ring and Rey goes up top for the seated senton and then Rey sends Del Rio into the ropes but Del Rio with a clothesline for a near fall.</p><p>Del Rio pushes Rey into the corner but he runs into a boot. Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio punches Rey until the referee warns him. Del Rio sends Rey’s back into the announce table followed by shoulders in the corner. Del Rio with the step up enzuigiri but Rey kicks out at two.</p><p>Del Rio shows some frustration and then he tries for the cross arm breaker but Rey with a rollup for a near fall. Del Rio with a drop kick and both men are down. Del Rio sets for the cross arm breaker again but Rey escapes. Rey with a rana that sends Del Rio into the ropes. Rey with the 619 but Rey lands on Del Rio’s knees from the turnbuckles and then Del Rio gets the three count.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Del Rio kicks Rey. Del Rio hyperextends Rey’s arm on the bottom rope. Then Del Rio slams Rey’s arm into the announce table. Del Rio puts Rey in the cross arm breaker.</p><p>John Cena makes his way to the ring and he goes after Alberto Del Rio. Del Rio leaves the ring with Ricardo Rodriguez.</p><p>Cena says that he is coming off one hell of a weekend. Cena says that he has a lot of reasons to be pissed off. It could be Triple H, but no. He is pissed off at a scumbag like Alberto Del Rio. After two guys in him and CM Punk give everything in the ring to give the title some integrity, Del Rio goes into business for himself to win the title. He says that Del Rio is not a champion, he is a target. Del Rio will realize that holding on to that championship makes everyone he knows is an enemy.</p><p>Cena says that CM Punk earned the right to be called a Champion. Del Rio cashed in a briefcase and got lucky. Cena says that Del Rio will have to defend that title and he won’t be as lucky against John Cena. Cena says that Del Rio’s destiny is John Cena kicking his ass.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/60802/ongoing-wwe-raw-report-last-nights-actions-explained-miz-is-a-master-spokesman-what-will-kevin-nash-do.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/60802/ongoing-wwe-raw-report-last-nights-actions-explained-miz-is-a-master-spokesman-what-will-kevin-nash-do.html?p=1</a></p>
