As a result, Kelly was fired by Vickie Guerrero. She also announced another rematch for Dolph Ziggler with guest referee Vickie Guerrero.</p><p>We are live on tape from Green Bay, Wisconsin and your announcers are Michael ‘Hey Truth, you can say hello to this crowd and get it right’ Cole, Josh ‘The Frozen Tundra’ Mathews, and Booker ‘Main Event Announcer’ T.</p><p>The ring is adorned with balloons, flowers, and other celebratory items along with Ricardo Rodriguez who introduces Alberto Del Rio, who drives into the arena.</p><p>As he walks to the ring, we see footage from last week when Hornswoggle hit Alberto and then Alberto decided to thank Hornswoggle with the shot to the groin by knocking him down. We then had Kofi Kingston come to the ring and Alberto put Kofi in the cross arm breaker.</p><p>Alberto introduces himself, but we already knew that. Alberto says that with Valentine’s Day around the corner, in addition to being a great athlete, the winner of the biggest Royal Rumble in history, and the man who will be in the main event at Wrestlemania; that doesn’t mean that there is no love in his heart. It is the other way. He has Ricardo come into the ring with a heart shaped box. Alberto says that he loves a lot of things. He loves his cars. He loves his beautiful country of Mexico. He loves the fact that the six superstars who hope to face him at Wrestlemania will destroy themselves in the Elimination Chamber.</p><p>He says that he loves the most in this life is ‘destiny’, as he opens the box to reveal the word written inside. Destiny loves him . . . Alberto Del Rio and we now see a photo of Alberto in the box. Alberto says that Aaron Rodgers may have won the Super Bowl, but unlike Aaron, he does not need to pretend that he is a Heavyweight Champion because it is his destiny and he will become the World Champion at Wrestlemania.</p><p>Kofi Kingston comes out and he stands on the stage with something to say. All Alberto talks about is destiny and the future, like he knows something that nobody else knows. Kofi says that nobody knows what the future holds and there is no such thing as a crystal ball. Kofi says that he knows about the past. He knows about Alberto beating him with the kendo stick last week. Kofi says that he may not know about destiny, but he knows about the present and it is just the two of them. Kofi says that this is Alberto’s destiny.</p><p>Kofi gets a kendo stick to show Alberto what he dealt with last week. Alberto begs for mercy so Kofi will not hit him. Kofi thinks about it, and he eventually hits Alberto and then after Alberto leaves the ring, Kofi destroys everything in the ring and throws balloons at Alberto. Kofi takes a swing at the photo of Alberto and he sends it deep to left field.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>Booker, Josh, and Michael talk about what just happened and while Booker liked what he saw, Cole is indignant about what Kofi did.</p><p><strong>Match Number One: Kofi Kingston versus Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>Alberto with a kick and punch followed by a series of punches to Kofi’s head until the referee pulls Del Rio off. Del Rio with a kick and knee. Del Rio with an Irish whip but Kofi with a forearm out of the corner. Kofi with kicks to Del Rio until he is pulled out of the corner. Kofi tries for a running boot into the corner but Del Rio moves and Kofi appears to have injured his foot. Del Rio with a back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio with a rear chin lock.</p><p>Kofi with punches to try to get out of the hold but Alberto pulls Kofi down by the hair and gets another near fall. Del Rio puts his knee in Kofi’s back along with the chin lock. Alberto with a knee and then he charges at Kofi but Kofi drops down and Del Rio goes through the ropes and lands on the floor. Del Rio returns to the ring and he is met with chops from Kingston. Kofi with a drop kick followed by the Superman punch.</p><p>Kofi with the Boom drop and then he sets up for Trouble in Paradise but he sees that Del Rio recovered too much so he tries for a splash into the corner. Del Rio charges into the corner and then Kofi moves and hits the pendulum kick. Kofi goes up top for a cross body and he gets a two count. Del Rio with a kick and then he gets Kofi on his shoulders but Kofi with elbows to escape. Kofi with SOS for a near fall when Del Rio grabs the ropes. Kofi sets up for Trouble in Paradise one more time. Del Rio sees it coming and he leaves the ring.</p><p>Kofi goes after Del Rio and he wants to send Del Rio into the ring steps but Del Rio is the one to use the ring steps as a weapon and he sends Kofi into the steps twice. Del Rio returns to the ring and he puts Kofi in the cross arm breaker and Kofi taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Del Rio takes some time to release the hold but he eventually lets go.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/article/55166/wwe-smackdown-report-alberto-del-rio-talks-about-destiny-the-corre-shows-unity-laycool-tease-disharmony-vickie-guerrero-shows-futility.html?p=1">http://pwinsider.com/article/55166/wwe-smackdown-report-alberto-del-rio-talks-about-destiny-the-corre-shows-unity-laycool-tease-disharmony-vickie-guerrero-shows-futility.html?p=1</a></p>
