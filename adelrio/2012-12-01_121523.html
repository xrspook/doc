But when the action took a massive turn with the emergence of World Heavyweight Champion Big Show, John Cena stormed the ring to even the odds for The Celtic Warrior.</p><p>With the “AJ scandal” hotter than ever following the ex–Raw General Manager’s involvement in a one-on-one match between John Cena and Dolph Ziggler Monday night, the Cenation leader made a rare appearance on the SmackDown stage with a pointed message to The Showoff.</p><p>Coming off their epic one-on-one battle, Cena didn’t hold back, calling Ziggler “a man whose greatest accomplishment is being World Heavyweight Champion for two minutes.” Then, claiming The Showoff “hides behind the power of Vickie Guererro,” Cena turned Ziggler’s recent criticisms of the 10-time WWE Champion around, and pointed the finger directly at Mr. Money in the Bank. And with Ziggler scheduled to face Sheamus in the night’s main event, Cena assured the WWE Universe it would be more of a fight than a match.</p><p>But Cena’s impassioned monologue was cut short by the sudden interruption of Alberto Del Rio, who told him he shouldn’t worry about Ziggler — he should instead worry about The Mexican Aristocrat. Claiming SmackDown is “his show,” Del Rio told Cena to leave “his ring.”</p><p>The Cenation leader answered with a fist to Del Rio’s face, after telling the affluent Superstar that, since he’s already here, he may as well have a match — and it’ll be against Del Rio!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-30/results-26072584">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-30/results-26072584</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>John Cena def. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p></p><p>It was a rivalry renewed, as John Cena battled Alberto Del Rio in an enormous Friday night opening act. With Dolph Ziggler looking on in the back, it was all Del Rio early on in the ring, as The Mexican Aristocrat mocked Cena’s trademark “you can’t see me” hand gesture. Despite the skill and ruthlessness of his opponent, however, Cena turned the tables on Del Rio — setting the stage for a fierce showdown.</p><p>In the final moments of the very physical encounter between the two former World Champions, Cena found himself tied up and hanging upside down in the corner. Del Rio seized his opportunity and charged his adversary. Cena dodged at the last second, though, causing Del Rio to eat the steel ring post. Cena connected with a big leg drop off the top rope, covering The Mexican Aristocrat to rack up an impressive blue brand victory.</p><p>As Cena celebrated at the top of the ramp, Dolph Ziggler emerged from backstage to ambush the Cenation leader, clocking him from behind with the Money in the Bank briefcase.</p><p>Stealing the show, indeed.</p><p>Later, with a clearly irate Cena pleading his case about Ziggler’s sneak attack, SmackDown General Manager Booker T told the Cenation leader, “I don’t need my show breaking down tonight.” The five-time WCW Champion went on to ask Cena to let the night’s main event — Sheamus vs. Ziggler — go on uninterrupted. Citing the fact he and Booker go back a long way, Cena agreed not to interfere.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-30/results-26072584/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-11-30/results-26072584/page-2</a></p>
