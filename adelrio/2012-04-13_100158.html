Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio are out to face Sheamus and Mean Gene Okerlund.<br>105. I guess we will get to see how mean Mean Gene can be.<br>106. Del Rio's new shirt is interesting. Is it supposed to be a Peso?<br>107. The hits just keep on coming. Howard Finkel is out to introduce Mean Gene and Sheamus.<br>108. Mean Gene's music is very fitting.<br>109. Michael Cole hopes The Fink doesn't cry. It was just the one time, Cole.<br>110. Del Rio tries to beat Sheamus in a striking contest but the big man is too much for him until Bryan causes a distraction.<br>111. Bryan tags in and starts giving Sheamus kick after kick.<br>112. You know that little rope the partner outside the ring is supposed to be holding at all times? Why do some people just ignore the fact that it's there and other guys hold it all the time?<br>113. Sheamus gets kicked by Del Rio outside the ring in a very nice exchange.<br>114. Mean Gene gets pulled in the ring and Bryan and Del Rio corner him.<br>115. Why is the ref not counting the illegal man in the ring?<br>116. All the legends come out to defend Mean Gene from the mean old heels.<br>117. Sheamus hits the Brogue Kick on Bryan to get the win for his team.<br>118. Ricardo Rodriguez gets pummeled by everyone in the ring.<br>119. This reminds me of the WWE's first ECW PPV where everyone hit Eric Bischoff with their finisher to end the night on a very happy note.<br>120. Michael Cole gets in the ring to thank everyone for a wonderful time tonight.<br>121. Pat Patterson lays out Cole with a punch and Sheamus' music hits.<br>122. I guess tonight was a fun one-time thing.<br>123. I enjoyed seeing Piper, Dusty and Cowboy Bob the best, but seeing all the legends is always nice too.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1140814-the-doctors-weekly-wwe-smackdown-recap-123-things-we-learned-loved-and-hated">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1140814-the-doctors-weekly-wwe-smackdown-recap-123-things-we-learned-loved-and-hated</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's WWE Super SmackDown Report 4.10.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Colin Rinehart on 04.10.2012<br><br>Randy Orton battled Mark Henry, Sheamus and Mean Gene Okerlund took on Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio in the main event, the WWE legends showed up and more! Check out 411's full WWE Smackdown report for all the details!<br><br>Sheamus/Mean Gene Okerlund vs. Daniel Bryan/Alberto Del Rio<br><br>Yep, this is our "main event" folks. Bryan doesn't even get his own entrance, being introduced in the ring when we return. Del Rio gets his extravagant one though, don't worry. Howard Finkel does the introduction for Gene Okerlund, and I can't help but reminisce about that famous promo with Okerlund training with Hulk Hogan many years ago. Sheamus and Del Rio start off with Del Rio eating a big elbow. Bryan and Del Rio trade quick tags and start to work Sheamus over in their corner, and I'm sure you can already see where this match is going. Bryan avoids the Brogue Kick from Sheamus and then sends him to the floor, where Del Rio takes out Sheamus with a kick to the head. Del Rio and Bryan bring Mean Gene into the ring now and even Ricardo Rodriguez jumps into the fun. Before they can jump him though, Piper's music hits and the Rowdy one alongside the rest of the legends all come out to distract Bryan long enough so that Sheamus can recover, give him the Brogue Kick, and pick up the win at 3:24. And we have our record breaking third big fat DUD of the show ladies and gentlemen, give them a round of applause.<br><br>After the match all of the legends, including Howard Finkel, beat down the heels and begin to celebrate. Michael Cole makes his way into the ring to crack some jokes and Pat Patterson punches him in the face just to wrap up this entire clusterfuck of a show in truly surreal fashion.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/233378/411%5C%5Cs-WWE-Super-SmackDown-Report-4.10.12.htm">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/233378/411%5C%5Cs-WWE-Super-SmackDown-Report-4.10.12.htm</a><br></p>
