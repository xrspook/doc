They say it is due to the fire earlier tonight. Santino attacks, but Del Rio kills him with a clothesline, and then lays the boots to him. Rights by Santino, but a suplex by Del Rio stops that. To the corner and kicks by Del Rio. He slaps Santino, and then works the arm in the ropes. A whip to the corner, and Santino sends Del Rio to the apron and then to the floor.

He says both Santino and Sheamus are beneath him, along with the fans. If it is not a world title match, he will not compete. So he will not compete until Summerslam.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/248677">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/248677</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's Instant Analysis 07.30.12: WWE Monday Night Raw</strong></p><p>Posted by Chad Nevett on 07.31.2012</p><p>SEGMENT TWO: Santino Marella vs. Alberto Del Rio</p><p>Match Result: Alberto Del Rio made Santino Marella tap out</p><p>Match Length: Six minutes, 45 seconds</p><p>Well, we asked for longer matches and the former less-than-a-minute encounters between Del Rio and Santino got almost seven minutes. Obviously, the phrase that comes to mind is "Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it." This was a two-minute squash match stretched out until Del Rio destroyed Santino easily. But, it was almost worth it for the short promo Del Rio cut after the match: "I just destroyed the US Champion like nothing! Like nothing! Santino Marella is beneath me! Sheamus is beneath me! All of you people are beneath me! If it is not a world title match, I will not compete. Starting today, I will not compete until SummerSlam." I really like that idea. Hopefully, they got the other way with Sheamus and have him wrestle more, destroying everyone in his path.</p><p>Rating: 6.5 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/248688">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/248688</a></p>
