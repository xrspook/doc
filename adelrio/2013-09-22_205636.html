I have to say that seeing it live is a much different experience than watching it on TV. The sounds, the actions, everything is very different. But I loved every minute of it. :)</p><p>The next match was ADR vs. RVD, and it was a title match. ADR came out first and I was fangirling like crazy. RVD came out next (unfortunately without Ricardo, again thanks to the “nonessential talent” cut). ADR grabbed a mic and told us that we had it wrong, it was A-D-R, not R-V-D. When the match started out, ADR of course tried to get away. It was back and forth for a while, until ADR tried to get away again. RVD ran out and brought him back to the ring. He was in control until ADR, who had his title when he got back in the ring, used that title to hit RVD in the head and lose by DQ, so keeping his title. RVD hit back though and had ADR laid out in the ring. When RVD was about halfway back up the ramp, out came Damien with his briefcase. He was just about to cash in when RVD came running back up, climbed the ropes and dove at Sandow, thwarting his cash in attempt. He also laid ADR out again, and then laid ADR on top of Damien and climbed up and landed right on them. That was freaking awesome. He was slapping hands on his way out, and caught the edge of mine, which was an awesome moment for me. :)</p><p>All in all, I would say that the extra money we spent to get floor seats was well worth it. I had the time of my life and I can’t wait to do it again!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://embarrett1231.tumblr.com/post/61923522873/my-first-wwe-live-event-experience">http://embarrett1231.tumblr.com/post/61923522873/my-first-wwe-live-event-experience</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE House Show Results (9/21): Fort Wayne, Indiana</strong></p><p>Published On September 22, 2013 | By mattboone | Wrestling News, WWE News</p><p>The following are results from the WWE live event in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The event was held on Saturday, September 21, 2013.</p><p>Rob Van Dam defeated Alberto Del Rio via Disqualification. This match went about nine minutes, with the finish coming when Del Rio used the belt as a weapon, which caused the DQ. After the match, Van Dam hit Del Rio with the Van Daminator, which prompted Damien Sandow to tease cashing in his Money In The Bank briefcase. He never did cash in, however, as Van Dam ended up cleaning house of he and Del Rio.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.sescoops.com/wwe-house-show-results-921-fort-wayne-indiana/86956">http://www.sescoops.com/wwe-house-show-results-921-fort-wayne-indiana/86956</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
