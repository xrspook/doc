ADR continues to dominate as Sin Cara occasionally fights back using his speed but ADR easily overpowers him. Sin Cara gets a two count off a DDT but Del Rio doesn't stay down for long and continues to dominate. The end comes as Sin Cara misses a top rope senton and Del Rio gets the cross armbreaker for the submission win.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio via submission. Nothing match that puts over Del Rio and does nothing for Sin Cara. Rating: *</p><p>After the match Sheamus celebrates up the ramp and is quickly jumped by Alberto who locks in the cross armbreaker over the edge of the stage as the show ends. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/246269">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/246269</a></p>
