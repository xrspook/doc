But, it was the presence of AJ that let to two earth-shattering post-match Brogue Kicks.<br><br>Looking to get under the skin of World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, No. 1 contender Alberto Del Rio journeyed to the ring in a boastful mood, following his post-match assault of The Celtic Warrior on Raw SuperShow this past Monday. (WATCH | PHOTOS) The Mexican Aristocrat recalled Sheamus’ suggestion to “never trust a hooligan” before promising he will break The Great White’s arm in nine days at No Way Out. <br><br>That guarantee brought Sheamus to the ring – or so it appeared. Instead, the WWE Universe quickly recognized a disguised Ricardo Rodriguez making light of the Irish brawler by mimicking his distinctive red hair, outfit and gestures. His over-the-top caricature drew the ire of the real Sheamus, who promptly made his way to the ring and took the fight to Del Rio and Rodriguez in short order. The fight would eventually spread outside the squared-circle, all the way up to the steel stage.<br><br>Before the aggressive Celtic Warrior and The Mexican Aristocrat could dole out any serious damage on each other, a slew of referees and former SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long emerged to put a stop to the chaos and make a huge announcement. Citing an order by John Laurinaitis – who was off preparing for his evaluation by a returning Mr. McMahon this coming Monday on Raw – Teddy announced that Sheamus would face Kane in the SmackDown main event, while Alberto Del Rio was scheduled to fight immediately – against The Great Khali!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-08/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-08/results</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Sheamus picks up the disqualification victory over Kane, with mass disruption for Del Rio and AJ</strong><br><br>BY Matthew Artus June 08, 2012<br><br><strong>Alberto Del Rio def. The Great Khali</strong><br><br>Following the chaos in the opening moments of SmackDown, Alberto Del Rio quickly found himself at the mercy of The Great Khali as the latter arrived ready to fight. In the opening moments of the match, it seemed that for each strike by The Mexican Aristocrat unleashed, The Punjabi Giant had a painful counterattack ready to throw back his way.<br><br>Khali seemingly had an answer for Del Rio’s every tactic – except one: Ricardo Rodriguez. As the 7-foot-1 skyscraping of a Superstar sized up his opponent for a knockout blow, Del Rio’s personal ring announcer climbed up to the ring apron and created enough of a distraction for his wealthy boss to gain the advantage.<br><br>With giant turning his attention to the sneaky Ricardo Rodriguez, Del Rio brought down his imposing adversary and locked in his signature Cross Armbreaker to cement the win.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-08/results/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-08/results/page-2</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Sheamus picks up the disqualification victory over Kane, with mass disruption for Del Rio and AJ<br></strong><br>BY Matthew Artus June 08, 2012<br><br><strong>World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus def. Kane by disqualification</strong><br><br>In a match made by Mr. Laurinaitis earlier, World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus clashed with Kane in the main event on SmackDown.<br><br>In the climatic final moments of their absolutely explosive match, the two intense Superstars took each other down with a fierce double clothesline. Before the action could continue, however, Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez charged their way to ringside. The latter jumped into the ring and attacked The Great White, giving the World Heavyweight Champion a victory by disqualification over a sizable Superstar in the process.<br><br>Kane recovered and looked ready to hit a post-match chokeslam on his Irish opponent. That was until AJ’s presence on the entrance ramp seemed to distract him – promptly leaving him wide open for a powerful Brogue Kick.<br><br>With the result of the match no longer in doubt and his No Way Out opponent fleeing up the entrance ramp, Sheamus instead chose to send a message of warning to Del Rio by annihilating his personal ring announcer with a vicious Brogue Kick.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-08/results/page-10">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-08/results/page-10</a><br></p>
