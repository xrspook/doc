Here are some highlights of what he said:</p><p>For him, the World Heavyweight Championship is the most important title in the WWE because it's the first title that he chased. He admitted that WWE gives more attention to the WWE Championship.</p><p>He was frustrated by not being used by WWE while in FCW and was about to go back to Mexico (CMLL), but someone told Vince McMahon to not let him go because they would be losing someone who could be huge.</p><p>He prefers being a heel to a face.</p><p>He thinks that the American audience does not like him because they don't like a Mexican being successful in an American company.</p><p>He bashed AAA and said that his salary was a joke, which is why he left.</p><p>He never thought to come to WWE, but said that he used to watch it when he was younger and he would be lying if he didn't dream of joining the company. He he never thought WWE would be interested in him and he was thankful that they are.</p><p>He also talked about the "smart mark" crowd the night after Wrestlemania. He expects those type of fans at Wrestlemania and the night after, and said that they really only like heels.</p><p>He made American fans hate him again at Payback.</p><p>He said that he got his black eye during a match with Daniel Bryan at a live event in Portland, OR, a couple of nights before SummerSlam. He tried to shoot shot down the rumors that he got in a fight at a bar.</p><p>He thinks Sin Cara gets injured simply by talking. He said that Sin Cara has great potential, but he is very injury prone. He said that he doesn't know what the situation with Sin Cara right now.</p><p>It saddens him that Rey Mysterio is injured, which is why he told Vince that the Latinos don't care if you're a face or a heel, all that they care is that a Latino is beating the "gringo."</p><p>He never liked being in FCW and said that it was one of the placed he hated the most. He admitted that his FCW run was for the best because he learned how to wrestle the WWE style. He kind of took a shot at Sin Cara when he said that people that don't go to FCW are where they are.</p><p>He really enjoyed doing the running over Santa Claus angle, however said that his son was worried that they would be no Christmas.</p><p>He wants to get to Wrestlemania 30 as champion.</p><p>He thinks that he is a future Hall of Famer.</p><p>Vince McMahon is a big fan of him and he is Vince's favorite heel.</p><p>The Undertaker is the "Godfather" in the WWE and said he would like to face him.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0910/565495/alberto-del-rio-talks-vince-favorite-heel/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0910/565495/alberto-del-rio-talks-vince-favorite-heel/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>More From Del Rio: Why Mysterio Hasn't Returned, Sheamus' Betrayal, RVD, HHH, Brother's Release</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | September 10, 2013</p><p>As noted earlier, Alberto Del Rio was interviewed by Tercera Caida, which airs on TVC Deportes. Here are some more highlights from the interview:</p><p>At Wrestlemania 28, the year he was injured, he was originally supposed to face Randy Orton.</p><p>It was a great moment for him to successfully defend his World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 29. He said that he and Jack Swagger had a good rivalry and match at the event.</p><p>He hates Twitter, even though he's actively on it. He said WWE forced him to get a Twitter. He said that Sheamus "betrayed" him because there were the only 2 superstars who did not have a Twitter account, and they made an agreement to never get a Twitter. However, when Sheamus opened a Twitter account, Stephanie McMahon forced him to open one.</p><p>He said Vince McMahon praised his match with Christian at Summerslam and said that Vince said they stole the show. He also said Christian is really underrated and a better wrestler than many in the company, and he is one of his favorite wrestlers to work with.</p><p>He said Triple H told him to give him a list of 5 Latino wrestlers he thinks can do well in the company so WWE can sign them.</p><p>Rey Mysterio was supposed to return the night after Summerslam, but he chose to return in Mexico.</p><p>He also said that Ricardo Rodriguez has great potential and that WWE wanted to split them months before they did, but he did not want to because they are good friends outside WWE.</p><p>He said that Rob Van Dam is a great opponent, but he doesn't know him that well. He admitted that RVD's signing was good for WWE.</p><p>Del Rio's cousin (Sicodelico, Jr.) said that he doesn't know why he was released (while in WWE developmental in 2009). He respects Del Rio's decision (to take his mask off) and said he would have done the same thing. He also said that Del Rio is a big star worldwide.</p><p>Del Rio said that the decision for his brother (Memo Montenegro) to be released was made by him (Del Rio) and the company around the time they were changing FCW to NXT, and said FCW/NXT is not the place to learn how to wrestle since his brother did not have very much wrestling experience.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0910/565497/more-from-del-rio-why-mysterio-hasnt-returned/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0910/565497/more-from-del-rio-why-mysterio-hasnt-returned/</a></p>
