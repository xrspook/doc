Triple H was knocked silly by Brock Lesnar at Extreme Rules. Then he faced Curtis Axel, but was physically unable to finish. Despite being cleared, Stephanie McMahon shows that she is more important than physicians because Triple H is not worth facing Curtis Axel. What will happen this week because Triple H said that he would be wrestling Curtis Axel tonight. Who wears the pants in the relationship? Hunter . . . Stephanie . . . Vince . . . Aurora Rose?</p><p>We are in Richmond, Virginia and your announcers are John ‘The South will rise again’ Layfield, Michael ‘Give Me Back My Son’ Cole, and Jerry ‘There will be payback if the Indians never win again’ Lawler.</p><p>Chris Jericho makes his way to the ring and he is dressed to fight, but he is going to talk.</p><p>Chris welcomes everyone to Raw is Jericho. He says that he knows that he has said this so many times and he has faced some of the greatest on Raw. The man who takes him to the limit more than anyone who makes him a better performer is the man he will be facing at Payback on Sunday . . . CM Punk.</p><p>You can say what you want about his attitude or opinions because he is so damn good because he believes that he is the best in the world. It is the same way that Chris says that he feels. That is why they are evenly matched opponents. They think the same way and they came into the business the same way. They accept no more than the best.</p><p>On Sunday, Punk/Jericho III continues the classic trilogy of matches that started at Wrestlemania 28, continued at Extreme Rules, and concludes at Payback. On Sunday, CM Punk will get his best because he needs to beat CM Punk at Payback.</p><p>No matter what happens on Sunday, neither of them will ever . . . everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr be the same . . .</p><p>Dolph Ziggler is back and he is joined by AJ Lee and Big E Langston.</p><p>Dolph says that since Chris was talking about the best performers, he figured it was time to come out. He almost had the title taken away from him by concussion. He was not going to sit at home. When it was almost taken from him, it was not fair to him. Dolph says that no one ever wanted him to have the title so he came out every night and he stole the show. He earned the title.</p><p>At Payback, he will prove to the world and to Alberto Del Rio that the moment he steps in the ring with him, he will be outclassed. He does it better than anyone in the ring and he is just getting started.</p><p>Chris interrupts and he says that Dolph is stepping ahead of himself. Chris says that this is Raw and since Del Rio is his opponent on Sunday, why not have a tune up match to get rid of some of that ring rust.</p><p>Ziggler asks Chris if he wants a match and he has a match . . . against Big E Langston.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: Chris Jericho versus Big E Langston (with Dolph Ziggler and AJ Lee)</strong></p><p>The match is joined in progress and Langston with a forearm to the back on the floor. Langston with a punch to Jericho and we are told that Jericho might have hurt his knee. They return to the ring and Langston with a forearm to the back and he gets a near fall. Langston with a nerve hold. Jericho with an elbow but Langston with a forearm. Jericho sends Langston over the top rope to the floor.</p><p>Jericho with a baseball slide that knocks Langston down on the floor. Jericho kicks Langston in the back and punches him. Langston sends Jericho into the ring steps. Langston sends Jericho back into the ring and he gets a near fall. Langston with shoulders in the corner and then he hits a running shoulder into the midsection. Langston with a forearm to the back and then he kicks Jericho in the ribs.</p><p>Langston with an Irish whip but Langston misses a shoulder and he goes into the ring post. Jericho gets a near fall with a rollup. Langston with a near fall after a shoulder tackle. Langston returns to the chin lock. Jericho with a kick to Langston followed by chops. Jericho with a running forearm and kick but Langston stays on his feet. Jericho with an enzuigiri to knock Langston to one knee and then Jericho with a drop kick for a near fall.</p><p>Jericho with kicks to Langston’s chest followed by a forearm. Langston catches Jericho and he hits three back breakers and then he gets a near fall. Jericho goes up top and hits a cross body for a near fall. Ziggler gets on the apron and he distracts Jericho. Langston with a running body block and then the straps are down.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio attacks Ziggler on the floor and that causes Langston to lose focus and he misses a charge into the corner and Jericho hits the Codebreaker for the three count.</p><p>Winner: Chris Jericho</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=78185">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=78185</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
