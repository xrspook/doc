It came down to Sheamus vs. Kane and Reigns vs. Orton. Orton escaped so Sheamus and Kane sandwiched Kane between ladders. Reigns tried to climb a ladder but was nailed by ADR. Sheamus went up another but it was toppled over by Kane. Cesaro and Reigns battled on another but that was toppled over. Kane began cleaning house on everyone.</p><p>He set up ladders then grabbed Orton for an apparent chokeslam but pulled him over to the ladder. He held it for Orton but Reigns nailed him and toppled the ladder. Orton looked like he hurt his arm or shoulder when he bounced off the ropes. Reigns used the ladder like a battering ram to Kane and then set up the ladder as HHH and Stephanie looked worried. Bray Wyatt prevented Reigns from getting to the top and they exchanged punches. Bray nailed Reigns but was caught with the Blue Thunder Bomb by Cena.</p><p>Cesaro tossed Cena into the air and nailed an uppercut. He went to the top but was met by Sheamus. They battled as Wyatt spider-walked to the ladder and shoved it over. Sheamus and Cesaro hung from the belts, hitting each other. Cesaro kicked him off and hung from the belts but was finally pulled down.</p><p>The announcers acknowledged that doctors were working on Orton. Orton did returned to the fray so whatever it was, he can work through it. He and Sheamus fought on the floor and Sheamus bridged a ladder between the announcers and the ring. He beat Orton into it and went atop the ladder bridge but Orton caught him and nailed the hanging DDT off the ladder.</p><p>Everyone ended up back in the ring (except Sheamus) and they all battled and tried to scramble up the ladder. Cesaro clotheslined over the top to the floor by Kane. ADR missed a leaping enziguiri and was tossed out. Kane was left in the ring. Sheamus returned and battled with him, nailing him with ten shots across the chest. Sheamus nailed a clothesline off the ropes on Reigns. He nailed White Noise on Orton. He set up for the Brogue Kick on Orton but saw Cena coming and nailed him instead.</p><p>Sheamus tossed Orton to the floor and set up as ladder in the middle of the ring. Kane grabbed his foot and dragged him to the outside. Sheamus reversed an Irish Whip and sent Kane into the stairs. Cesaro bridged a ladder between the corner and a ladder, then ran across it to stop Sheamus from grabbing the belts. They battled atop the ladder. ADR shoved the ladder inside the bigger one. Reigns tipped the ladder over, so it was supported by the smaller one jutting out. Cesaro held on hanging them pulled himself around to stop Sheamus from getting the belts. Cena set the structure back the way it should be. Cena joined the fight but was sent down crashing on the ladder bridge.</p><p>Cesaro was knocked off and Sheamus went for the belt but was pulled down by Orton and Kane and beaten. Sheamus was dumped to the outside. It looked like Kane would help Orton get the belt but Reigns speared him. Orton smashed the ladder into Reigns’ head. Orton went for the RKO but was shoved off and nailed with the Superman Punch. Reigns began killing everyone with a ton of hot moves and sent Wyatt into the annnouncer’s table and speared Cesaro on the floor.</p><p>Cena returned to the ring as Reigns was going for a ladder and they faced off. They went back and forth until Reigns speared Cena. The Authority were calling for Kane to get up. Reigns climbed the ladder but Orton pulled him down and nailed a series of shots across the back. Orton did his backbreaker variation off the ladder. Orton was bleeding from the back of the head. He went to climb the ladder but Wyatt nailed him with Sister Abigail.</p><p>Wyatt climbed but was attacked by ADR with a leaping enziguri. He made it to the belts but was forced off the ladder and hit with a Brogue Kick by Sheamus. He climbed up but was yanked off by Cesaro, who nailed him with an uppercut as he came down, then nailed the Neutralizer. Cesaro climbed up but was yanked off into an RKO by Orton.</p><p>Orton climbed up by Reigns grabbed his leg and peppered him with punches. They battled on the ladder, slamming each other’s head into the ladder. Orton was really blood by now. Reigns finally took him out with a headbutt but Kane grabbed Reigns and chokeslammed him down.</p><p>Orton began climbing up again but Cena returned and nailed them both with AAs and got the belts.</p><p>Your winner and new WWE World Heavyweight champion, John Cena!</p><p>They pushed that Cena now had won the belts 15 times.</p><p>Good car crash match with tons of insane spots, original ideas using the ladder and a ton of hard work across the board. They weren't as spectacular as the other ladder match but I thought the last few minutes was just great. Cena winning is going to get a lot of people talking.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=86596">http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=86596</a></p>
