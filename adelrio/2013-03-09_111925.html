Stating that those who disagreed with them were part of the problem, Colter reinforced that he and Swagger were the solution.</p><p>But the No. 1 contender to the World Title at WrestleMania and his impassioned cohort were soon interrupted by Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez, who countered their inflammatory rhetoric with hilarious parody. Presenting a video in which they were dressed as Swagger and Colter, the pair mocked their adversaries’ message — leaving the subjects of their ridicule seething as they pointed out the growing threat of Mexican food.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-03-08/results-26096517">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-03-08/results-26096517</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio def. Dolph Ziggler</strong></p><p>With Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter keeping a close eye from the back, World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio took on Dolph Ziggler — in an explosive contest made by the WWE Universe last week, via Twitter, during the highly successful Social Media SmackDown. And prior to the match, Mr. Money in the Bank promised to make history.</p><p>Early on, Big E Langston interfered in the action. But, when he chose to pursue an instigating Ricardo Rodriguez outside the ring, it was AJ Lee who ended up getting a bucket of water thrown on her. This made things go from bad to outright chaotic as the emotional Diva snapped, charging after Del Rio’s friend and eventually causing the referee to eject both her and Big E from ringside.</p><p></p><p>In the final moments of the knockdown, drag-out match that followed, Del Rio once again showed the guts and resilience of a true World Champion, fighting back from the impressive efforts of The Showoff to thwart his Zig Zag attempt and make him tap out to the Cross Armbreaker.</p><p>Shortly after the match, a still-soaked AJ Lee and ex-boyfriend Daniel Bryan rekindled their tremendous dislike for each other.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-03-08/results-26096517/page-5">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-03-08/results-26096517/page-5</a></p>
