Orton, Steel Cage Match, Bad Night For Axel</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | December 26, 2013</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Hassan for sending in these results from tonight's WWE live event at Madison Square Garden in New York City, NY:</p><p>MSG is 95% filled at least.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio vs. Rey Mysterio Crowd was very into the match from the beginning. Nice pop for Del Rio. After the usual back and forth Mysterio gets the pin via the 619.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1226/568664/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1226/568664/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE House Show Report 12.26.13: New York, New York</strong></p><p>Posted by Larry Csonka on 12.27.2013</p><p>WWE returned tonight to Madison Square Garden for their annual post-Christmas live event, a tradition that has been running for decades. In fact, 12/26 was the 30th anniversary of Bob Backlund losing the WWF title to the Iron Sheik and Backlund was there tonight, taking photos with fans in front of a green screen in the newly renovated lobby of the Garden for $30 a pop.</p><p>Before the show began, WWE had fans texting and Tweeting messages about their excitement over the show, which were flashed on the new digital screen hanging above MSG. They also showed photos from fans in attendance and in a new wrinkle, had roaming cameramen shooting the crowd before the show, sort of like Major League Baseball would at a game. They also had fans text voting over the stipulations of the Divas segment, which led to the crowd cheering and booing as they received updates on the screens about where the percentages of their votes were.</p><p>Justin Roberts was the ring announcer and while he does a fair job, I'll parrot what I write about every time WWE runs MSG - Howard Finkel is the voice of MSG and should be ring announcing at least the main event, but in a perfect world, the entire show.</p><p>The show opened with Rey Mysterio defeating Alberto Del Rio, who was obviously cleared to return to the ring from his concussion. Mysterio looks much heavier these days and in keeping with the NYC theme of the show, wore a red and blue Spider-Man inspired mask and outfit. This was a good opener with some nice back and forth wrestling, although Rey was obviously steps behind where he used to be and at one point, was limping early. They did a nice job teasing the 619 before finally getting there and Rey nailed a splash off the top for the pin.</p><p>Notes: The show was close to, if not a legitimate sellout, although some of those tickets (at least 600 seats) were part of a LivingSocial.com promotion that marked down pairs of tickets and came with a signed item and some other goodies....NXT talent Brandi Runnels (Cody's wife) was backstage....They heavily pushed a 3/9 return to the venue for a house show with Batista headlining, plus Cena, Daniel Bryan and the Wyatt Family advertised. There is already a pre-sale using code WWEMSG....One entire side of ringside was made up of the WWE VIP Experience ticketholders, who took home a specialized WWE chair similar to those given away to WWE PPV ringside seat patrons....In a change for MSG, they aired a video stream from a hard camera shot of the entire show on every screen in the venue. At times, it was hard to look at the ring and not be distracted by the massive screen showing the same thing right above you....They had a holiday themed stage with a blow-up snowman and Christmas tree....Rap legend DMC was in attendance with his family. He's a regular at the NYC area events.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/308081">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/308081</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
