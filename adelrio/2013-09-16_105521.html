PRIMETIME PLAYERS: LIVE, ONGOING WWE NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS COVERAGE</strong></p><p>By Mike Johnson on 2013-09-15 21:10:00</p><p>Welcome to PWInsider.com's live, ongoing coverage of WWE Night of Champions 2013 from Detroit, Michigan.</p><p><strong>World champ Alberto Del Rio vs. Rob Van Dam</strong></p><p>Van Dam started out strong with some hard kicks to the face and a series of shoulderblocks. RVD hit a monkey flip out of the corner followed by a standing moonsault for a two count. He preened to the crowd, and whipped ADR into the ropes. ADR held on and nailed him with a dropkick. RVD rolled out of the way of a move and dropkicked ADR through the ropes to the floor.</p><p>RVD draped him on the guard rail and nailed a corkscrew legdrop. RVD went for a suplex into the ring but ADR reversed it and sent him to the floor. ADR hit a tope to the outside, then tossed Rob hard into the railing.</p><p>Del Rio tossed Van Dam back into the ring and cinched in a side chinlock. Rob fought his way out but was suplexed over and drilled in the back with a stiff kick.</p><p>Del Rio continued working him over and nailed a belly to back suplex. Rob rolled out to the apron but was drilled with an enziguri when he stepped up to his feet. Del Rio went for another dive but RVD stepped out of the way and no money in the pool. RVD drilled him with a series of clotheslines but was caught and whipped into the corner. RVD nailed an elbow and killed him with a thrust kick out of the corner for a two count.</p><p>RVD went to the top for a Ryder Kick off the ropes. He went for Rolling Thunder but Del Rio rolled out of the way and nailed the Backstabber for a two count. Del Rio nailed RVD with several slaps to the back of the head and placed him atop the turnbuckles for a reverse suplex. RVD fought back and nailed ADR to the mat.</p><p>Rob went to the top and nailed a flip dive for a two count. Del Rio came back to nail a series of near falls. He looked to set up RVD for the armbreaker but RVD drilled him and nailed the Hollywood Star Press for a two count. ADR made a comeback and worked over RVD but went to the top, only to be caught with a heel kick.</p><p>RVD called or the Frog Splash and went to the top. He nailed the move but ADR pulled his knees up and locked in the Crossarmbreaker in the center of the ring. RVD finally fought to the ropes and broke the hold, only ADR refused to break and was disqualified.</p><p>What an absolutely sh**ty finish to a PPV World title match.</p><p>Your winner by DQ, Rob Van Dam!</p><p>The match was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's a shame because with the level of talent involved, this should have been awesome. The creative didn't help either.</p><p>After the match, Del Rio attacked Van Dam and worked him over. He grabbed a chair but Ricardo grabbed it. RVD made a comeback and Ricardo suggested they do the Van Terminator, although they didn't use that name. RVD nailed it and Alberto sold it like he was dead. That spot is always fun to see but it doesn't make up for the finish. Michael Cole called the move the "Van Daminator." Whoops!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=80298">http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=80298</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
