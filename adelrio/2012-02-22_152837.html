He is capable to do aereal moves even when he is 6'5 tall (1.95 cm), and enough strong to held up a standing suplex and a military press, he also was member of the olympic mexican team of greco-roman wrestling , so he has basics, has mexican high-flying style, has american locks, and skills of mma, THIS MAN IS A COMPLETE PACKAGE!! SO PLEASE WWE!! USE HIM RIGHT , USE HIM FINE AND PLEASE DO NOT WASTE HIM AS YOU DID WITH ULTIMO DRAGON AND SUPER CRAZY!!<br><br>I hope that with this i woke up some interest and trust into my wrestling knowledge to bring this man a chance<br><br>HE IS DOS CARAS JR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>All characters are not mine are (c) to someone else.<br>The art is (c) to me<br><br>PLEASE PEOPLE DO NOT STEAL, DO YOUR OWN CRAP!!!!!!<br></p></blockquote><p>转载自：<a target="_blank" href="http://matoonz.deviantart.com/art/WWE-The-Two-Faced-One-129871467">http://matoonz.deviantart.com/art/WWE-The-Two-Faced-One-129871467</a><br></p></p>
