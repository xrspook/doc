Cole vows that his home away from humanity will be better than ever.</p><p>Alberto is not as gregarious as he usually is but he reminds us who he is, but we already knew that. Alberto says that we may not know that destiny can be delayed. He says that destiny can be stopped. Last Sunday at Wrestlemania, his destiny was delayed by that opportunist Edge and the coward Christian. Together they destroyed his Wrestlemania moment and together they destroyed his car. Alberto talks about his beautiful Rolls Royce and he says that he spent $120,000 on that car. Alberto says that it is not about the money. Those cars are like his children. They think they may have broken him, but Alberto will make them pay.</p><p>When he fulfills his destiny and becomes the World Champion, everything that Edge did to his car . . .</p><p>is interrupted by Edge’s music and he comes into the building on a Brisco’s Brothers tow truck with Alberto’s destroyed Rolls Royce.</p><p>Edge tells Alberto that when he saw him crying and hugging his car on Sunday, he thought that Alberto was a greedy, arrogant, narcissistic moron who puts materialistic things over everything else in his life. Then when he heard Alberto say that his cars are like his children, then it got him thinking. He almost reassessed things and he figures that if he is like a child, he needs to love it unconditionally. It might be a little damaged but nothing a little tender loving care can’t fix.</p><p>Edge gets some spray paint and he decides to do a little touch up on the hood.</p><p>Alberto asks Edge if everything is a joke to him and then he reminds Edge that he had him close to tapping out on Sunday. Edge tells Alberto that he didn’t get the job done and that is why Alberto is in the ring whining and crying. That is also why he is the World Champion.</p><p>Alberto demands a rematch so Edge can redeem himself for his behavior at Wrestlemania.</p><p>Edge thinks about the rematch and he tells Alberto as much as he would love to give it to him, but Alberto lost. Edge tells him to buy a new car and drive to the back of the line. Edge says that there are so many worthy contenders who deserve a title match.</p><p>Edge thinks about some contenders and there is some honking from the truck and we see that Christian is driving the truck.</p><p>Edge says that Christian deserves a title match. Edge points out that Christian has beaten Del Rio twice. Edge tells Del Rio if he wants a fight, Edge has his destiny.</p><p>Edge walks to the ring but he is stopped by the sound of Teddy Long’s music.</p><p>Teddy tells them to wait a minute. They can talk about their destiny all they want, but it is still his show. Teddy says that if things are going to be settled, it will take place in a match. Alberto Del Rio will face Christian tonight to determine who faces Edge at Extreme Rules.</p><p>Teddy reminds us that Extreme Rules is the night that WWE gets extreme. That is why Edge will be defending the title in his specialty match, a ladder match.</p><p>It is time for the main event and we get Ricardo Rodriguez to introduce Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>Before the match starts, Edge makes his way to ringside to watch the match.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez and Brodus Clay versus Christian in a Number One Contender’s Match</strong></p><p>They lock up and Del Rio with a waist lock.
