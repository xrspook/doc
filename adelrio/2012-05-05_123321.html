On May 20, he will meet the Superstar who loves to do just that. The Mexican Aristocrat battles Sheamus for the World Heavyweight Championship at WWE Over the Limit.<br><br>Del Rio will face a champion who has been on an absolute tear, depriving Daniel Bryan of the World Heavyweight Title in 18 seconds at WrestleMania XXVIII and emerging victorious in a grueling 2-out-of-3 falls rematch at Extreme Rules. Since then, The Great White has continued clashing with the embittered submission specialist while also taking on other formidable opponents like The World’s Strongest Man, Mark Henry. Now, the Irish brawler must defend his title against one of WWE’s most dangerous and distinguished Superstars in Alberto Del Rio.<br><br>After several months away from competition due to injury, Del Rio made his exultant return the day after WrestleMania, on the April 2 Raw SuperShow. Confronting Sheamus and vowing to become World Heavyweight Champion, the ambitious Superstar made no secret about his intentions to reenter the World Title picture and reclaim his place at SmackDown’s summit.<br><br>The Mexican Aristocrat took the first step toward those lofty goals when he defeated Sheamus on SmackDown on April 6. Although Del Rio’s controversial disqualification win that night was a non-title victory, it guaranteed him a future World Heavyweight Championship Match. Since then, interactions between the two grapplers have grown more and more intense, especially since Del Rio and his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, were officially traded from Raw to SmackDown on April 20.<br><br>The conflict between Sheamus and Del Rio did not truly explode until the May 4 edition of SmackDown, though, as both the No. 1 contender and Daniel Bryan viciously applied their signature submissions to Sheamus’ already damaged left arm. The injured appendage of the champion could play a significant role in the Over the Limit title match, as Del Rio is – no pun intended – a handful.<br><br>Opportunistic and ruthless inside the squared circle, The Mexican Aristocrat is known for systematically deconstructing his opponent. Capable of high-flying or powerful moves when necessary, Del Rio prefers to fight a smart fight, allowing his tremendous grappling technique and experience to carry him to victory. His devastating finisher, The Cross Armbreaker, can easily end a contest – or a career – in a split second. Sheamus experienced just a taste of the move’s effectiveness and brutality firsthand on SmackDown.<br><br>Though clearly dangerous, Del Rio is far from the inevitable victor. The World Heavyweight Champion is a true powerhouse, a bruising Celtic thumper with an in-ring style reminiscent of a runaway train. If The Great White utilizes his strength and gains momentum in a match, he’s nearly impossible to stop. He also boasts remarkable speed and athleticism for such a large and physically imposing man, leaving adversaries few options in the squared circle. With no shortage of ferocious finishing moves of his own – The Celtic Cross, White Noise and the deadly Brogue Kick – Sheamus is also capable of ending a match in the blink of an eye, or, more appropriately, a boot to the eye.<br><br>An X factor in this bout is the health of each Superstar. Del Rio is returning after a long absence with a freshly healed body and a full tank of gas. Sheamus, on the other hand, is coming off a prolonged and taxing rivalry with Bryan, in addition to working an exhausting travel and competition schedule. His injured appendage, courtesy of both Del Rio and Bryan, will make retaining his title even more of an uphill battle.<br><br>On Sunday May 20, the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina will play host to a donnybrook, as World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus puts his title on the line against the aggressive and arrogant Alberto Del Rio. Can The Mexican Aristocrat stop the momentum of the surging Great White and become WWE’s new World Heavyweight Champion?
