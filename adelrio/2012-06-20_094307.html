DEL RIO退出？告诉那个自大的笨蛋：不。然后，告诉他FUCK HIMSELF。然后，FUCKYOU。”这个Twitter写道。<br><br>F4WOnline.com报道称Del Rio在当天和高层管理发生冲突，并威胁退出WWE。一些公司消息人士表示Del Rio对于他的地位不满，并打算离开。第二位消息认为表示这次事件“并不是什么大事情”，双方在就合同事宜争吵。第三位消息人士认为这次争吵是以上两条原因的结合。<br><br>Del Rio是有退路的：他并不发愁收入，可以以一名前WWE Superstar和著名luchador DosCaras的身份回到墨西哥。一位公司雇员在周一晚上透露对于Del Rio的脑震荡的真实性表示怀疑，指出他受伤“太严重”以至于无法参加周日的No Way Out pay-per-view赛事，然后却非常健康地参加了RAW。这位雇员认为脑震荡只是在掩盖Del Rio和高层的问题，作为把他从和Sheamus的腰带战中去除的理由。</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.19977.com/viewthread.php?tid=8879489">http://www.19977.com/viewthread.php?tid=8879489</a> <br></p><blockquote><p><strong>Alberto Del Rio reportedly threatened to quit WWE last week</strong><br><br>F4WOnline.com reports that Del Rio had a dispute with upper-level management last week.

While the account mocking WWE's creative direction returned online following some profile tweaks (now located @WWECreative_ish), the McMahon parody remains down.<br><br>The @CrankyVince account spoofed McMahon's demeanor and mindset with random musings depicting the WWE Chairman as eccentric, maniacal, sex-crazed, drug-addled and racist. It had drawn alarming concern from organization officials since last year, who due to the sensitive nature of the tweets, believed it was being handled by an employee within close proximity of McMahon. The account would divulge legitimate company information, which is a breach of Twitter's Terms of Service. According to F4WOnline.com, the McMahon mockery account is reportedly administered by an assortment of current WWE employees. The publication, however, would not disclose particular names.<br><br>Before its suspension, @CrankyVince had endorsed an alternative account (located @PremiumVince). The account has posted several messages in Cranky Vince's trademark tone since the suspension of the premiere account.<br><br>The @CrankyVince account was coincidentally shut down the day it released a message stating that Alberto Del Rio wanted to quit WWE.<br><br>"WHAT? DEL RIO WANTS TO QUIT? TELL THAT POMPOUS ASS: NO. THEN, TELL HIM TO GO f*** HIMSELF. THEN, f*** YOU," the tweet read.<br><br>F4WOnline.com reports that Del Rio had a dispute with upper-level management that day and threatened to quit WWE. One company source says Del Rio was frustrated with his standing and contemplating a departure. A second source said the incident 'wasn't that big a deal' and that both sides were wrangling over a contract matter. A third source believes the spat was a combination of both accounts.<br><br>Del Rio has leverage; he has no issues with income and could return to Mexico as a heralded former WWE Superstar and son of noted luchador Dos Caras. A company employee expressed skepticism Monday night that Del Rio had legitimately suffered a concussion, noting that he was "too injured" to work the No Way Out pay-per-view event on Sunday but healthy enough to work Raw. The employee believes the concussion was a cover excuse for issues that materialized between Del Rio and officials, necessitating his removal from the title match against Sheamus. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/342154664.shtml">http://nodq.com/wwe/342154664.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE News: Backstage News on Alberto Del Rio Threatening to Quit the WWE<br></strong><br>By Chris Humphrey (Featured Columnist) on June 19, 2012<br><br>Following his WWE debut during the summer of 2010 on SmackDown, Alberto Del Rio has made quite an impact in the company with two WWE title reigns along with winning the 2011 Royal Rumble and Raw Money in the Bank match.<br><br>Even though he was getting pushed to a lot of early success in the past two years, there might be some trouble brewing between Del Rio and the WWE in regards to the way things have been going in recent months.<br><br>Here are the details from F4WOnline (via WrestlingInc.com) on the situation between the former two-time WWE Champion and the front office of the company in recent weeks.<br><br> F4WOnline.com reports that Del Rio clashed with upper-level management that day and threatened to quit WWE.

Another said it wasn't actually that big a deal, rather wrangling over a contract issue. A third source said it was probably a little of both.<br><br>Alvarez also noted that many in the company doubted the concussion injury to Del Rio. The injury led to Del Rio being pulled from his No Way Out title match against Sheamus, and Dolph Ziggler getting the spot instead.<br><br>However, in what was very strange timing, Del Rio was perfectly fine to work last night's episode of Raw, in which he took on comedy wrestler Santino Marella, crushing him in a quick squash match. <br><br> One person in WWE Monday night expressed skepticism that Del Rio ever had a concussion to begin with, noting that he was "too injured" to work No Way Out Sunday but apparently fine to work the following night on Raw. They suggested the concussion could have been a cover story for issues that came up between Del Rio and WWE that necessitated pulling him out of the match with Sheamus.<br><br>Interestingly, this is not the first report discussing Del Rio's less-than-smooth relationship with WWE. AAA wrestler and matchmaker Konnan recently talked about the star almost walking out of the company before he was ever called up to the main roster.<br><br>Del Rio, it seems, had grown frustrated with being stuck down in Florida Championship Wrestling, WWE's developmental territory, and had threatened to quit, citing financial and personal issues.<br><br>Per Konnan, there was also frustration from the WWE side towards Del Rio regarding his inability (or unwillingness) to learn a more American style of wrestling. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1228349-wwe-news-problems-brewing-between-alberto-del-rio-and-management">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1228349-wwe-news-problems-brewing-between-alberto-del-rio-and-management</a> <br></p>
