Just ask Alberto Del Rio.<br><br>Since his first days in WWE, The Mexican Aristocrat has stated that winning World Championship gold was his destiny. While it’s true that he’s been able to capture the WWE Title on two separate occasions, the Superstar’s recent bid to capture the World Heavyweight Championship has been littered with a series of almosts and could-have-beens. Moreover, four months after his return to WWE, Del Rio still hasn’t gotten his much deserved one-on-one title match for that elusive prize, which has led WWE.com to wonder: Is Del Rio being shortchanged?<br><br>Following the controversial ending in his No. 1 Contender’s Contract-on-a-Pole Match on Monday’s Raw SuperShow against Dolph Ziggler, Del Rio will compete in a Triple Threat Championship bout on Friday’s SmackDown – once again putting him up against the odds. With just a 33 percent chance of emerging from the match as World Champion, it’s feasible The Mexican Aristocrat comes away empty-handed even if he isn’t pinned by the eventual victor.<br><br>How did Del Rio get to be in this position, and can he make the most of it?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-22/del-rio-short-changed">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-22/del-rio-short-changed</a></p><blockquote><p> <strong>Is Alberto Del Rio being shortchanged?</strong><br><br>BY Alex Giannini June 26, 2012<br><br><strong>Bumps in the road</strong><br><br>Del Rio has long argued he hasn’t been given a fair shake since his return to SmackDown. He may well have a valid point, as a string of unfortunate events and injuries have stunted his attempted rise back to the top. And it all happened under the watch of the now-former General Manager of Raw and SmackDown, John Laurinaitis.<br><br>Following WrestleMania, with Mr. Excitement firmly in control, The Mexican Aristocrat won a match against World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus that made him the No. 1 contender and earned him a one-on-one bout against The Great White with the title on the line. All of that changed, however, when Big Johnny opted to put the Irish Champion at a greater disadvantage at WWE Over the Limit.<br><br>Instead of facing the champion head-to-head, the match was altered and Del Rio suddenly found himself thrown into a Fatal 4-Way for the illustrious title. When the dust cleared on that whirlwind match that also included Chris Jericho and Randy Orton, Sheamus was victorious – though not by pinning Del Rio.<br><br>Then, heading into No Way Out in June, The Mexican Aristocrat secured his second World Title opportunity in a row. But again, destiny would deliver him a crushing blow.<br><br>When The Great Khali’s giant hand connected squarely with the top of Del Rio’s head, the aristocratic Superstar was sidelined with a concussion that forced him to sit out the upcoming pay-per-view. His chance to challenge Sheamus one-on-one once again went out the window.<br><br>With the Triple Threat Title Match Friday looming, can Del Rio alter the course of his destiny?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-22/del-rio-short-changed/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-22/del-rio-short-changed/page-2</a><strong></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Is Alberto Del Rio being shortchanged?</strong><br></p>BY Alex Giannini June 26, 2012<br><br><strong>Del Rio's next stop?</strong><br><br>With SmackDown's coming showdown, Del Rio has once more clawed his way into a title opportunity. Yet, the former champion finds himself in a similar situation this week, as come Friday night, Del Rio will be one of two contenders fighting The Celtic Warrior for the title.<br><br>One has to wonder — would such a match have been made if Laurinaitis were still General Manager? Once again denied a one-on-one opportunity against Sheamus, Del Rio has to feel vexed. But is this all simply a bit of bad luck, just as his concussion was? Or is there someone looking to purposefully keep Del Rio down?<br><br><p>Alberto Del Rio truly believes the invisible hand of destiny is guiding him to his fate. However, when it comes to the question of whether that inevitable conclusion is a place he will want to go to, the aristocratic Superstar will simply have to take his chances.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-22/del-rio-short-changed/page-3">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-06-22/del-rio-short-changed/page-3</a> <br></p>
