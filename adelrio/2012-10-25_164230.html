Del Rio took out his frustration on Christian with a post match attack, but it was stopped by Edge, who wanted to get close to Alberto’s car. Edge did not get to repossess the car because Brodus Clay attacked Edge from behind.</p><p>We move to tonight’s show and Edge is in Teddy Long’s office and Edge’s arm is wrapped up due to last week’s attack. Edge tells Teddy he is getting hit in the arm each week. Edge says that Teddy’s ruling doesn’t make sense because what goes around comes around. He says that he is not getting a chance to go after Alberto and then he suggests that Teddy is showing some favoritism towards Alberto.</p><p>Teddy says that what he is doing is in the best interest of the WWE and the Smackdown main event at Wrestlemania.

Edge tells Christian that he will be in his corner tonight for Christian’s match against Alberto Del Rio. Edge wants to show the world and Alberto that he is one hundred percent and nothing is going to stop him at Wrestlemania.</p><p>Alberto is in Teddy’s office complaining about the ‘No Contact’ rule that Teddy established for Edge and Del Rio. Alberto tells Teddy that he is not done with Edge yet. He has nine more days until Wrestlemania and that means nine more things he can do to Edge.</p><p>Teddy tells Alberto what he told Edge earlier tonight. That is if either man touches the other, they will both be out of Wrestlemania.</p><p>Alberto tells Teddy that he does not have the guts to ban him.</p><p>Teddy points out to Alberto that there have been twenty-six Wrestlemanias without Del Rio, and he wants Alberto to try him to see if it will be twenty-seven. He tells Alberto to worry about his match with Christian.</p><p>Alberto winks at Teddy and leaves.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: Alberto Del Rio with Brodus Clay and Ricardo Rodriguez versus Christian with Edge</strong></p><p>They lock up and Del Rio with a knee and forearm to the head.
