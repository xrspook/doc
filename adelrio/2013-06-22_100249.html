After Payback, what will happen as we move forward to Money in the Bank and SummerFest (where have you gone Jeremy Piven). We saw a few people return on Monday night and we also saw a man show that he does not want a doctor to stop him despite an injury.</p><p>We are in Toledo, Ohio and your announcers are John ‘Jamie Farr’ Layfield and Michael ‘Why do I have to wear a dress tonight’ Cole.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Chris Jericho versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriuez)</strong></p><p>They lock up and Del Rio with a side head lock and shoulder tackle.

Del Rio sends Jericho into the ringside barrier and then he kicks Jericho in the ribs. They return to the ring and Del Rio gets a near fall. Del Rio with shoulders in the corner.
