Raw and guided her through some turbulent seas.</p><p><strong>Kane def. Alberto Del Rio by Disqualification; Big Show attacked</strong></p><p>If you’re going to hurt Big Show by running him over with an automobile, next time make it a Hummer. Two weeks after his assistant , Ricardo Rodgriguez, “accidentally” plowed into The World’s Largest Athlete, Alberto Del Rio faced the wrath of the freshly rehabbed Big Show.</p><p>Del Rio had been battling Big Show’s partner, Kane, when he was disqualified for refusing to relent on a Cross Arm Breaker. Afterward, a vengeful Big Show charged the ring and clobbered The Mexican Aristocrat. Rodriguez jumped the towering terror to save his boss, who scurried from the ring as his lackey took a lashing.</p><p><strong>Guest GM “Stone Cold” Steve Austin confronted The Miz, arranged first match</strong></p><p>The Miz may be arrogant, but he isn’t ignorant. At least he proved to have a smidgen of smarts when he was confronted by Raw’s guest General Manager, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, who will oversee WWE All Star Night, a three-hour spectacle featuring Superstars from Raw and SmackDown.</p><p>The Texas Rattlesnake told The Cleveland Screamer that he wasn’t about to apologize for nailing him with a Stunner the week prior. Rather than run his trap, Miz kept quiet for the most part, and listened as the WWE Hall of Famer informed him that he and his rival, Alex Riley, will air their differences later in the night with “Rowdy” Roddy Piper on Piper’s Pit.</p><p>After sending Miz scurrying, “Stone Cold” was then interrupted by Alberto Del Rio. The Mexican Aristocrat poured out some hollow boasts before The Texas Rattlesnake cut him off. “Stone Cold” explained to Del Rio that he didn’t much care for him ever since one of his luxury autos “accidentally” plowed into Big Show. Therefore, The Mexican Aristocrat would be forced to face off against Big Show’s former tag partner, Kane.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-06-13/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-06-13/results</a></p>
