Maryse agrees with Del Rio. Booker decides to spin the wheel for Alberto, but Del Rio wants the woman from the Great White North to spin. Maryse tries to sweet talk Alberto since he has money but then we see that the stipulation is a Steel Cage Match so the engagement is off.</p><p>We are back with the Slam of the Week: Big Show destroying Mark Henry two weeks ago followed by Mark Henry destroying Big Show and an announce table at Capitol Punishment.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Big Show versus Alberto Del Rio in a Steel Cage Match</strong></p><p>Del Rio tries to climb over the top of the cage, but Show stops Del Rio with a chop and then he gives Del Rio a head butt. Show with a chop across the chest. Show sends Del Rio into the cage and then he puts Alberto’s face against the cage and he follows it with a head butt. Show with an Irish whip but Del Rio with a drop kick to the injured knee. Del Rio with more kicks to Show to keep him on the mat and Del Rio with a near fall but Show with a powerful kick out. Del Rio returns to the knee as he keeps Show grounded.</p><p>Mark Henry makes his way to ringside to watch the match a little closer than he could in the back. Henry takes a lap around the cage while Del Rio continues to work on the leg. Show with a chop and clothesline to Del Rio. Show sets for the choke slam but Del Rio with a kick and a low DDT for a near fall.</p><p>Del Rio climbs the cage by the door without realizing the door is right in front of him. Show stops Del Rio and they fight in the other corner. Show with a superplex on Del Rio.</p><p>Mark Henry tries to open the cage door using the handle, but he figures it is easier to rip the door off the hinges and four years later (give or take), he breaks the door off the cage.</p><p>Henry brings the door into the cage and then Henry kicks Show in the head. Del Rio crawls out of the cage and hits the ground to win the match.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Henry grabs the door and he is not done with Show. Henry with a splash using the door with Show on the apron and the cage wall collapses. While the medical staff checks on Show, Henry has some words with the fans.<br></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=59348">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=59348</a></p>
