As noted, WWE has big plans for Del Rio's return and that's why he was kept of WrestleMania.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/335415914.shtml">http://nodq.com/wwe/335415914.shtml</a><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's Instant Analysis 04.02.12: WWE Monday Night Raw</strong><br><br>Posted by Chad Nevett on 04.02.2012<br><br>SEGMENT FIVE: Alberto Del Rio Returns to Challenge the new World Heavyweight Champion<br><br>Well, they moved past Daniel Bryan rather quickly, didn't they? Alberto Del Rio's return isn't a surprise necessarily, but him returning right when Sheamus came out was. He was arrogant and immediately played into Laurinaitis's obvious bias towards the heels that stood behind him. The mic cutting out was a forced way to lead into the Brogue Kick when they'd already established Del Rio turning to Ricardo Rodriguez to say his name and that being a more organic opening. I assume because of what we saw backstage, Bryan isn't out of the picture yet. Still, this set up Del Rio/Sheamus on Smackdown Friday.<br><br>Rating: 6.0 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/232234">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/232234</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's WWE RAW Report 4.2.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Tony Acero on 04.02.2012<br><br>We come back to the sounds of Sheamus's music, and you can hear the boos pour in. Sheamus is wearing the gold and a smile. Before Sheamus can even say three words, the music of Alberto Del Rio hits and here comes Ricardo Rodriguez to announce the man!! Del Rio points out the win of 18 seconds as the crowd chants "Daniel Bryan." Del RIo says that just as fast as Sheamus won the title, he's going to lose it. Now, he has a new challenger, and this challenger doesn't hide behind a "chica." And or course, this challenger is Alberto Del Rio. HAHAHAA The crowd starts a "SI! SI! SI! SI!" chant! Sheamus starts and the crowd boos him, hard. He says that these people want to see him Brogue kick someone right in the face. He's glad that Del Rio is out here, because now he gets an opportunity to show these people something they will never forget. Del Rio says he's not looking for a fight, because he already has one. In honor of his return, Johnny Ace has agreed to give him a match on Smackdown. And that match is Sheamus vs Alberto Del Rio for a future World Heavyweight Title shot. Daniel Bryan chants begin, again. Del Rio's mic goes in and out for some reason. Del Rio switches with Ricardo, then turns right into a Brogue Kick! Del Rio walks away from this, grabbing his ear...which kind of cheapens the move a bit, I'd say.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/232230">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/232230</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>BROCK LESNAR RETURNS TO WWE: COMPLETE RAW REPORT</strong><br><br>By Mike Johnson on 2012-04-02 21:15:07<br><br>They showed stills of Sheamus winning the belt last night from Daniel Bryan.<br><br>Justin Roberts introduced Sheamus. The majority of the Arena booed him. It's going to be a promo. I expect Daniel Bryan chants aplenty. Nope, no time as Sheamus was about to cut a promo when out came Alberto Del Rio, introduced by Ricardo. The announcers put it over as the last two Royal Rumble winners being face to face.<br><br>Del Rio told Sheamus that he won the World title in record time. The Arena chanted for Daniel Bryan. Del Rio told him that no one will remember the title win in a month, because he has a new challenger, one that doesn't hide behind a chica - Alberto Del Rio. The crowd chanted "Thief" at Sheamus. Sheamus told Alberto it was great to see him because the people don't want to see him talk but kick someone in the face. More boos for Sheamus. The fans chanted, "No! No! No!"<br><br>Del Rio said that he isn't looking for a fight, since he has one already. Del Rio announced John Laurinaitis has given him a match against Sheamus for Friday and if he wins, he gets a title shot. He started to cut a promo as the Bryan chants began again. Del Rio's mic went out so he stammered and started again, then it went dead. He turned to Ricardo to get his and turned back into a Brouge Kick.<br><br>The crowd reactions completely killed the segment, which was pretty damn funny.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/67313/brock-lesnar-returns-to-wwe-complete-raw-report.html?p=1"></a><a href="http://http://www.pwinsider.com/article/67313/brock-lesnar-returns-to-wwe-complete-raw-report.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/67313/brock-lesnar-returns-to-wwe-complete-raw-report.html?p=1</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Another Off Air Report From Last Night’s WWE Raw</strong><br><br>Posted by Larry Csonka on 04.03.2012<br><br>- The Yes chants have totally caught on and are officially the new What?! Chant, for better or worse. One thing is for sure though - Daniel Bryan has not been damaged one bit by his WM28 loss. I realise tonight's crowd was comprised of many overseas fans who came for Mania, and who are generally 'smart'(ish), but the entire crowd were chanting Yes throughout the show. In a hilarious bit, when Del Rio came out to face Sheamus, Del Rio got a "Si, Si, Si" chant.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/232252">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/232252</a><br><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/67313/brock-lesnar-returns-to-wwe-complete-raw-report.html?p=1"></a></p>
