AND WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE WWE CHAMPION; JOHN CENA'S FATE IS DETERMINED; THE TITLE SITUATION IS STILL IN THE AIR</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-07-18 23:15:22</p><p>We are live from Green Bay, Wisconsin and your announcers are Michael ‘What about Sin Cara’s Trampoline’ Cole and Jerry ‘Where in the World are Carmen Sandiego and CM Punk’ Lawler.</p><p>Vince McMahon’s music plays as Day One of WWE Under Punk and he comes to the ring with John Laurinaitis and the entire WWE locker room is watching in the back. The crowd chants ‘CM Punk’ and Vince isn’t sure what to do. Vince says that you will never hear him say that man’s name again. Vince says that they don’t get it. They are chanting the name of the biggest ingrate in WWE history. A man who turned his back on each and every one of you. He walked out on everyone in the locker room. He walked out on everyone who has ever been in this ring. He is nothing more than an egotistical, selfish turd. No one is bigger than the WWE and no one will ever be bigger than the WWE. Vince says that this is a global marketing promotional juggernaut that cannot be stopped.</p><p>Tonight, a new WWE Champion will be crowned tonight. Eight of Raw’s best will compete in a single elimination tournament. Rey Mysterio will face Dolph Ziggler. Jack Swagger will face R Truth. Kofi Kingston will face Alberto Del Rio. Alex Riley will face the Miz.</p><p>Miz advances to face the winner of the Alberto Del Rio/Kofi Kingston match in the second round.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio drives into the arena and he has something to say.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio comes out and he has changed his name to Mr. Money in the Bank Alberto Del Rio. Alberto reminds everyone that he won the Money in the Bank Ladder Match so he has the right to have a title match at any time and any place. He tried to cash it in last night, but CM Punk ran and ran like a chicken. All of this happened because John Cena couldn’t do the job. He says that he hopes that John Cena gets fired because the WWE needs a new leader. A better one, a stronger one. A superstar that everyone can respect. Alberto says that we all know that it is his destiny to be the WWE Champion.</p><p>Ricardo Rodriguez comes out and he announces Alberto as the winner of the Money in the Bank match since he was not there last night.</p><p><strong>Match Number Three: Alberto Del Rio versus Kofi Kingston in a First Round Tournament Match</strong></p><p>They lock up and Del Rio backs Kofi into the corner and Del Rio with a kick and snap mare followed by a drop kick to the head and he gets a near fall. Kofi with a forearm and drop kick for a near fall. Del Rio with a kick to the leg followed by a knee to the head. Del Rio with a shoulder tackle but Kofi with a leaping back elbow after a few leap frogs.</p><p>Kofi leaps into the corner and he punches Del Rio before rolling out of the corner. Kofi with a European uppercut for a near fall. Del Rio sends Kofi into the ropes and Del Rio misses a splash into the ropes when Kofi moves. Del Rio goes to the floor and Kofi hits a suicide dive onto Del Rio.</p><p>Del Rio is sent back into the ring and Del Rio hits an enzuigiri and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with knees to the back of the head before getting another near fall. Del Rio with a reverse chin lock. Del Rio sends Kofi to the mat as he continues to work on the head and neck. Del Rio with a kick to Kofi for a near fall. Del Rio with an elbow drop for another near fall. Del Rio returns to the reverse chin lock. Del Rio with a head butt and then he sends Kofi into the corner but he runs into an elbow. Kofi with a kick to Del Rio and then Del Rio misses a running drop kick into the corner and Del Rio lands on his shoulder.</p><p>Kofi with chops followed by a drop kick and then he hits the Superman punch. Kofi sets for the Boom Drop but Del Rio rolls out of the way. Del Rio kicks Kofi away and then he hits a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Del Rio punches Kofi. Del Rio sets for the rolling cross arm breaker, but unlike every other time he does it, he takes his time and that allows Kofi to get a rollup and the three count.</p><p>Winner: Kofi Kingston</p><p>Kofi advances to face Miz in the semifinals.</p><p>Rey Mysterio walks in the back as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back with a SummerSlam Rewind: Footage from Davey Boy Smith versus Bret Hart from 1992 in Wembley Stadium.</p><p>We see footage of the pinfall in the Kingston/Del Rio match and Cole claims that Del Rio was robbed, but Cole has a change of heart.</p><p>Kofi Kingston is in the interview area with Josh Mathews. Josh asks Kofi for his thoughts about advancing in the tournament. Kofi says that he was in one of the most brutal and devastating matches in WWE history. He came up short last night but tonight is a new opportunity. Kofi took the first step to becoming the new WWE Champion. One down, two to go.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/article/59978/wwe-raw-report-we-have-a-new-man-on-top-and-we-arent-talking-about-the-wwe-champion-john-cenas-fate-is-determined-the-title-situation-is-still-in-the-air.html?p=1">http://pwinsider.com/article/59978/wwe-raw-report-we-have-a-new-man-on-top-and-we-arent-talking-about-the-wwe-champion-john-cenas-fate-is-determined-the-title-situation-is-still-in-the-air.html?p=1</a></p>
