Teddy is not in a dancing mood and he says that after last week’s contract signing and what just happened, it appears that they still have some issues. Tonight will be one of the most historic nights in the history of Smackdown. Brodus Clay and Alberto Del Rio will face one of the greatest tag teams ever, reunited for the first time in ten years, Edge and Christian.</p><p>Christian is in the locker room getting ready for his match and Matt Striker stops by to get some comments from Christian about reforming his tag team with Edge. Christian points out that it has been ten years. A lot of things can happen in ten years. Christian runs down all of the technological breakthroughs that we have seen in that time. Christian says that we haven’t seen the two guys who started this decade off right. We haven’t seen the two guys who reeked of awesomeness. That was then and this is now. He tells Alberto Del Rio and Houston . . . we have a problem.</p><p>Edge stops by and they go to the ring for their match.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: Brodus Clay and Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez versus Edge and Christian</strong></p><p>Clay and Christian start things off and Christian with punches to Clay and then he goes after Del Rio.
