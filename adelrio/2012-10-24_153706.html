Chavo thinks that he is going to inhale helium from the balloons, but his voice does not change and Kaitlyn tells Chavo that there is no helium in the balloons. Chavo can’t believe that and walks away. We see the return of the Chris Masters Pectacular and he is watching Hornswoggle try out but he does not have the same technique as Masters, but Hornswoggle leaves with Kaitlyn.</p><p>Big Show is telling Kelly that she is a big girl and she can make her own decisions, but since they are BFFs, he warns Kelly about Drew. He tells her to be careful. Kelly thanks Show for the advice.</p><p>Cody Rhodes steps up to the Resolution mic and he says that he has an announcement. Cody wants to know how, as the face of Smackdown, that he can go on with Big Show trying to break his nose. Good thing Big Show is standing right next to Cody so he can respond. Show tells Cody that is his first mistake because if he wanted to break his nose, it would be broken.</p><p>Teddy interjects and says that the party every year seems to end up having a fight. Show says that it wouldn’t be much of a fight but Teddy does his job preventing a fight . . . so far. Teddy says that after what he saw in the ring, he wants to announce two matches for the first Smackdown of 2011. Alberto Del Rio will face Rey Mysterio in a two-out-of-three falls match. Kane will face Edge for the World Title in a Last Man Standing Match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/53976/wwe-smackdown-report-the-intercontinental-title-in-the-spotlight-there-is-a-party-going-on-and-you-know-how-it-will-end-the-battle-for-the-heart-and-soul-of-kelly-kelly-continues.html?p=">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/53976/wwe-smackdown-report-the-intercontinental-title-in-the-spotlight-there-is-a-party-going-on-and-you-know-how-it-will-end-the-battle-for-the-heart-and-soul-of-kelly-kelly-continues.html?p=</a></p>
