We then see Kane’s comments about how he did not do it. Little did we know that he did do it. We move to Kane being confronted by Undertaker and Kane’s response.</p><p>We are live on tape from Albany, New York and your announcers are Matt ‘Capital City’ Striker and Todd ‘Hey Cole, how old will Snooki be when Smackdown has its 900th episode’ Grisham.</p><p>The somber tone is gone because it is time for a fiesta and your host is being introduced by Ricardo Rodriguez. Alberto Del Rio drives in style into the arena and he is wearing white to show his purity.</p><p>While Alberto comes to the ring, Todd mentions that Rey Mysterio has a fractured wrist.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio reminds us who he is and everyone already knows that. Alberto asks everyone if they remember what he did to his Amigito, the little Chihuahua, Rey Mysterio. In case you missed it, we have the footage from last week. Alberto is proud of his work and he says that he is showing this celebration because he has removed Rey Mysterio from the WWE. He says that he proved to everyone that Mysterio is a weak representation of the Mexican people. He says that Mysterio is a Chicano and he is ashamed of it and that is why he wears his mask. He says that Rey is like an animal. He compares Rey to a burro, and he shows us a piñata with Rey’s mask on it. Alberto hits the piñata and shows us that Rey is full of candy. He says that Mysterio is nothing but a broken burro. Alberto gets some champagne and makes a toast. Alberto says that he is handsome, powerful, and rich. He says that he is everything.</p><p>Christian comes out and apologizes for interrupting. Christian wants to introduce himself to Alberto and he asks Alberto who he is . . . and Christian interrupts and calls him JBL. . . . Juan Bradshaw Layfield. Christian says that he is kidding. He says that everyone knows who Alberto is. He is a huge international star and calls him Enrique Iglesias. Christian starts to sing Hero and Alberto says that Christian thinks that he is funny. Christian tries a hors d’oeuvre but he does not like the taste and spits it out. Christian says that he didn’t come out to taste his crappy hors d’oeuvres, marvel over his expensive cars or tailor made suits. He wants to says that he did not appreciate what Alberto did to a friend of his, Rey Mysterio. Christian says that Alberto can hit all of the donkey piñatas he wants, but Alberto is the only jackass that he sees. Alberto yells at Christian for ruining his fiesta and disrespecting him. He says that Christian wants to end up like Rey Mysterio and cry in a hospital. Christian asks Alberto if he is looking for a fight because he has a match tonight. However, he will fight Alberto tonight in front of his peeps.</p><p>Alberto tells his manservants to leave the ring. Alberto takes off his jacket and he gets in Christian’s face. Christian says something to Alberto and Alberto smiles and backs away. Alberto picks up his jacket and he is about to leave the ring. He says that there is going to be another place and another time. He says that Christian will pay for this. Alberto leaves the ring.</p><p>Christian watches Alberto leave the ring and Alberto winks at Christian. Alberto points at Christian and that means that Christian should have looked because Drew McIntyre attacks him from behind and sends Christian to the floor. Alberto pours some champagne on Christian and stands over Christian before leaving.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=50570">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=50570</a></p>
