Also, the passionate AJ struck again, two more Superstars qualified for The World Heavyweight Title and two WWE Hall of Famers showed up to help celebrate America’s birthday.<br><br>Turning up his nose at America, Alberto Del Rio promised that he will win the World Heavyweight Title from Sheamus at Money in the Bank and beat him so badly that he would send him back to Ireland like a little girl.<br><br>The Mexican Aristocrat then began to torment the Corpus Christi, Texas, crowd, insisting that they were no different than Sheamus – confronting several audience members and demanding to see their “papers.”<br><br>When he tried to get one of them kicked out for not producing them, The Celtic Warrior came to the rescue – attacking his No. 1 contender and igniting a fierce brawl that spread all the way to Del Rio’s car. Thanks to a disturbance by Ricardo Rodriguez, Del Rio gained the upper hand and proceeded to slammed the hood of his ride down upon The Great White over and over again.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-07-03/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-07-03/results</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SuperSmackDown LIVE results: Ryder reigned supreme in The Great American Bash 20-Man Battle Royal</strong><br><br>BY Michael Burdick July 03, 2012<br><br><strong>Zack Ryder won The Great American Bash 20-Man Battle Royal<br></strong><br>Because of an earlier injury at the hands of his Money in the Bank No. 1 contender Alberto Del Rio, the WWE Universe learned that World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus was not able to compete in the main event 20-Man Battle Royal that would determine next week’s SmackDown Interim GM. (MORE ON SHEAMUS) <br><br>With WWE’s top talent including WWE Champion CM Punk, Big Show, John Cena, Kane, Cody Rhodes, Intercontinental Champion Christian, Daniel Bryan, Dolph Ziggler and The Mexican Aristocrat himself, it had the potential to be the greatest Battle Royal of all time from the opening bell. Among such an elite group of competitors, even gigantic athletes like Brodus Clay and The Great Khali were destined to be eliminated in the blink of an eye.<br><br>In the final moments, after Kane eliminated both Big Show and Ziggler with an explosive boot, he turned his wrath on his final opponent, Zack Ryder. After escaping the chokeslam, however, the heroic Long Island Iced-Z suddenly dropped the top rope, sending his monstrous adversary sailing to the ringside floor to shock the WWE Universe to its very core.<br><br>As a result of his earth-shattering triumph, Zack Ryder will run SmackDown next week as the latest Interim General Manager!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-07-03/results/page-9">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-07-03/results/page-9</a> <br></p>
