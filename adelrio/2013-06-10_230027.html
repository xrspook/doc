He then went on to say that he would come back out later to watch his bodyguard & BFF Big E Langston beat Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>Tony Chimmel then informed us that we could choose whether Del Rio vs. Big E would be a 2 out of 3 Falls Match Or a No DQ match.</p><p><strong>Match 7: Big E Langston w/ Dolph Ziggler & AJ Lee vs. Alberto Del Rio w/ Ricardo Rodriguez</strong></p><p>Ricardo & Del Rio came out to good pops. I don't know who the crowd likes better.</p><p>Tony Chimmel informed us that this match would be a No DQ match.</p><p>Big E. used a lot of power moves and Del Rio got in quite a few kicks. I was happy to see a Kendo Stick used in this match by both competitors. Langston missed with a chair, but brought a table into the ring. When AJ & Dolph tried to enter the ring, the Referee sent both of them to the back. Del Rio was able to get his finisher applied to Big E, but Big E was able to pick him up like we've seen a couple of times on TV. However, this time Del Rio dropped to his feet and was able to spear Big E into the table that was set up in the corner. Del Rio then made the cover for the 3 count. Match went close to 20 mins. There was a lot of Si, Si, Si chants during this match.</p><p>Winner : Alberto Del Rio</p><p>Biggest Pops: Sheamus Del Rio & Ricardo The Uso's</p><p>Mixed Reaction: AJ Lee Dolph Ziggler</p><p>Most Heat: Curtis Axel Big E</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/273601-wwe-live-event-results-69-fayetteville-nc">http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/273601-wwe-live-event-results-69-fayetteville-nc</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Update: Dolph Ziggler Claims He's Still Not Medically Cleared to Return to the Ring</strong></p><p>by Mike Killam June 10, 2013</p><p>Dolph ZigglerAlthough Dolph Ziggler was expected to return to action this weekend during a WWE Live event tour, facing Alberto del Rio, he was replaced by Big E Langston. The World Champion reportedly was ringside for the match, but did not get physical in any way. Ziggler cut a promo for the live crowd before the bout saying that he had yet to receive medical clearance from his doctors, which is why he was being replaced.</p><p>WWE has been advertising Ziggler for Monday Night Raw tonight, including his in-ring television return. We will have more on his condition when it becomes available, but last night could simply have been WWE's way of giving Ziggler more time to rest before his return on Raw.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/273591-update-dolph-ziggler-claims-still-not-medically-cleared">http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/273591-update-dolph-ziggler-claims-still-not-medically-cleared</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
