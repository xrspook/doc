Brown & Bobby I. on 2013-04-09 21:46:36</p><p>J. Brown & Bobby I. sent along the following Smackdown spoilers:</p><p>*Big E. Langston opened the show doing a Ricardo Rodriguez impression as he introduces the new World champion, Dolph Ziggler. Ziggler comes out with AJ and cuts a promo about how he is the most physically gifted athlete WWE has ever seen. He says the future is now. He has no voice. Ziggler says this moment belongs to him and him alone.</p><p>Jack Swagger comes out. Zeb Colter congratulates Dolph and says Ziggler should thank Swagger for the win. Ziggler blows them off and tells Sewagger to get to the back of the line. Alberto Del Rio comes out and Ziggler says he can hobble to the ring if he wants his rematch. Alberto says when his ankle is healed, he is coming for his title. Chris Jericho came out and tells Ziggler to shut the hell up. Jericho is awesome and gets the crowd to chant that AJ is crazy. This sets up Y2J vs. Ziggler for later.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/76819/ongoing-smackdown-spoilers.html">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/76819/ongoing-smackdown-spoilers.html</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SPOILERS WWE SmackDown Results For This Friday: Triple H Appears, How Was The Crowd?</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | April 09, 2013</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com readers @DrVoDre and 'Where is Christian?' for sending in these results from tonight's Smackdown taping at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts:</p><p>There are a lot of kids in the crowd, so I can't see the crowd being like last night. A Fandango theme song chant was a fail early on.</p><p>Right before SmackDown started, there was a highlight of Triple H getting medical attention after WrestleMania. They showed a graphic that he will be here tonight, and the place went nuts.</p><p>The show starts with Big E Langston doing his best Ricardo Rodriguez impersonation. He introduces Dolph Ziggler, who comes out to a huge pop. Dolph cuts a promo and is trying hard to be a heel. He talked about cashing in and said that he is better than everyone. He was losing his voice during the segment. He is interrupted by Jack Swagger and Zeb. Zeb says that Swagger wants a title shot. They leave and Ziggler continues acting cocky when Alberto Del Rio comes out limping. Del Rio said that he is not upset over Ziggler cashing in since he knows what it is like to hold the Money In The Bank briefcase. He says he wants a title shot and leaves. Chris Jericho comes out. The crowd is starting to turn on Ziggler. Jericho tells Ziggler that his first opponent as World Champion is Chris Jericho and that match is tonight.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0409/561934/wwe-smackdown-spoilers/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0409/561934/wwe-smackdown-spoilers/</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
