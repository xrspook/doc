Also, The Usos battled 3MB and Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett squared off with fellow WWE NXT alum Justin Gabriel.</p><p><strong>Big Show def. Alberto Del Rio via count-out</strong></p><p>On the Jan. 8, 2013, episode of SmackDown, Alberto Del Rio defeated Big Show in a brutal Last Man Standing Match to fulfill his destiny and win the World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rio defeated The World’s Largest Athlete in a second Last Man Standing contest at Royal Rumble and in a singles match at Extreme Rules. Since then, the Mexican hero has focused his attention on his WrestleMania 29 opponent, Jack Swagger, but as evidenced on ION Television, the animosity between Big Show and the World Heavyweight Champion still boils. Although the title was not on the line, Big Show was certainly seeking revenge on a personal level against the World Champion. The World’s Largest Athlete’s rage was further stoked by an attack by The Shield during his battle with Seth Rollins on Raw. Big Show and Del Rio immediately exchanged offensive maneuvers — highlighting the in-ring familiarity both Superstars have developed with one another.</p><p>Just as momentum swung in the World Heavyweight Champion’s favor, his WrestleMania 29 challenger, Jack Swagger — with his founding father Zeb Colter in tow — made his way onto the entrance ramp. The “Real American” and Colter maintained a watchful eye on Del Rio as Big Show used the distraction to regain control of the contest. The World’s Largest Athlete focused his offense on Del Rio’s arm and shoulder — a tactic normally used by the World Heavyweight Champion in an effort to set up his patented Cross Armbreaker.</p><p>The WWE Universe in Fort Wayne, however, was firmly in support of Del Rio. Feeding off the energy in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum, Del Rio battled back, executing an impressive hurricanrana on the giant, followed by a seated senton to regain full control of the bout. As the World Heavyweight Champion prepared for his Cross Armbreaker, Big Show managed to overpower him and dump him over the top rope and to the outside.</p><p>As the WWE official began his 10-count, he was distracted by Big Show, allowing Jack Swagger to attack Del Rio’s leg. Unable to regain his footing and the official unaware of the “Real American’s” actions, the World Heavyweight Champion failed to answer the 10-count, ultimately securing the victory for Big Show.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwemainevent/2013-03-13/results-26098625">http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwemainevent/2013-03-13/results-26098625</a></p>
