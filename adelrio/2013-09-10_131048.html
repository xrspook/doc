Now that we are North of the Border, will the ‘Bizarro’ nature of the product in Canada change things or will it be the standard operating procedure as we move closer to Night of Champions.</p><p>We are in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and your announcers are John ‘Five Second Pose’ Layfield, Jerry ‘If I ever get fired to get married, do you have my son’s phone number available’ Lawler, and Michael ‘Kazoos Still Rule’ Cole.</p><p>We are back and R Truth is rapping in the ring.</p><p>Rob Van Dam has some thoughts in the Goldman Box. Alberto may call himself the champion tonight, but on Sunday, dude, the new champion will not be ADR, but RVD.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio versus R Truth in a Non Title Match</strong></p><p>They lock up and Del Rio with a side head lock and shoulder tackle. Truth with punches and forearms in the corner. Del Rio with a thrust kick and punches in the corner. Truth with a kick to Del Rio and he misses a clothesline but Truth with a few to send Del Rio over the top rope to the floor. Truth with a pescado onto Del Rio and both men are down on the floor.</p><p>Del Rio with an enzuigiri to Truth on the apron. Del Rio slams Truth’s head into the apron. They return to the ring and then Del Rio gets a near fall and he applies a reverse chin lock. Truth with a sunset flip for a near fall but Del Rio with a clothesline. Del Rio with a near fall on Truth and then he returns to a reverse chin lock.</p><p>Truth with punches but Del Rio with a knee and head butts. Truth with a leg lariat and clotheslines. Truth with a kick and a sit out gourdbuster for a near fall. Truth misses the scissors kick and he tries for the Lie Detector but Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl slam. Del Rio with a super kick and then he applies the cross arm breaker and Truth taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>Before the next match starts, Alberto Del Rio comes out and he calls Van Dam a washed up loser. He calls Ricardo a peasant. Without Alberto Del Rio, Ricardo is nothing. The two of them belong with each other, just like him and his belt belong together. After Night of Champions, the people won’t be chanting RVD . . . they will be chanting ADR.</p><p><strong>Match Number Eight: Rob Van Dam (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Ryback</strong></p><p>Van Dam with a twisting drop kick and a springboard thrust kick. Van dam tries for a monkey flip but Ryback blocks it and sends him to the mat. Ryback with a back elbow and punches. Ryback with forearms to the back. Ryback with a belly-to-belly throw and then he slams Van Dam’s head into the mat.</p><p>Ryback with an abdominal stretch. Van Dam blocks being sent into the turnbuckles and Van Dam with a kick. Ryback catches Van Dam off the turnbuckles and he escapes and hits a step over spin kick. Van Dam with Rolling Thunder followed by a senton off the turnbuckles for a near fall.</p><p>Van Dam with a thrust kick and then he goes up top but Ryback goes to the floor. Van Dam tries for a cross body onto Ryback on the floor but Ryback moves and Van Dam hits the ringside barrier.</p><p>Ryback crotches Van Dam on the ring post and the referee calls for the bell.</p><p>Winner: Rob Van Dam (by disqualification)</p><p>After the match, Ryback sends Van Dam into the ring post again and then he brings Van Dam back into the ring for the marching muscle buster.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=80173">http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=80173</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
