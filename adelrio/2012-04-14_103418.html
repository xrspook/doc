Anybody who frequents this site probably knows that I’m a reporter, but the other day, I suggested to Eric that perhaps I could review action figures for the site, as a lot of internet wrestling fans are into action figures, and I’ve got a ton of them (I’m a geek; Sue me)! I figure I’ll go over 5 main points related to the figure in each review:<br><br>- Sculpt: How does this toy look? Is it accurate, inaccurate, what?<br>- Articulation/Playability: As a collector, can you get this thing into the right poses?<br>- Paint: This isn’t a huge deal for me, unless the paint is very bad, but I know it’s important to a lot of people, so I’ll go over it.<br>- Accessories: Does this figure have accessories? If so, are they even good?<br>- FUN Value: Are you going to get EXCITED about this figure?<br><br>I guess I’ll rate the figure in terms of those 5 things and give an average at the end. I know there’s really nothing too special about the categories, but going over things like this is a tried and true method of reviewing figures. I’ve decided to make my first review a fairly new figure, Mattel’s WWE Basics Series 12 Alberto Del Rio.<br></p></blockquote><p>转载自：<a target="_blank" href="http://quickwrestlingnews.com/2011/10/action-figure-review-mattel-wwe-basics-series-12-alberto-del-rio/">http://quickwrestlingnews.com/2011/10/action-figure-review-mattel-wwe-basics-series-12-alberto-del-rio/</a><br></p></p><p>SCULPT: 10/10Well, let’s get started by saying that this Alberto Del Rio may be the most well sculpted Mattel figure I own. Mattel is a notoriously frugal company, and they tend to reuse bodies and parts like it’s going out of style. While that generally works well, it sometimes results in some pretty funky looking bodies on their WWE figures. This Del Rio however, is perfect. Obviously, Del Rio is a fairly tall guy; He’s skinny, yet muscular. Mattel has created an all new torso piece, that perfectly fits Del Rio, resulting in perhaps their most accurate figure to date.</p><p>Mattel also creates a new headsculpt for each figure, and ADR is flawless in terms of that as well. The head on this Del Rio is the most accurate looking headsculpt ol’ Matty has ever produced.</p><p>In terms of sculpt, I literally have nothing bad to say about Del Rio. You couldn’t possibly get any better than this.</p><p>ARTICULATION/PLAYABILITY: 7/10The articulation on this figure is standard Mattel Basic articulation. For those unfamiliar, that means Del Rio has a ball jointed neck allowing for 360 degree turning and the ability to look up, down, left, and right, hinged arms that allow full rotation, hinged elbows so that you can pose his arms, and hinged wrists so the hands can be moved up and down.</p><p>And, the sculpt of the hands, combined with the arm poseability and hinged wrists, allow you to pose ADR in his patented “I’m pointing at my mouth!” pose!There’s also a swivel waist, allowing, again, 360 degree torso turning. In terms of upper body, all Mattel Basics are stacked. In the lower body, however, things begin to falter a bit. Del Rio has cut legs that allow movement up and down, hinged knees that allow bending, and Mattel’s notoriously bad rocker ankles, which allow you to move the figure’s feet.</p><p>Now, in terms of articulation that’s not bad. He’s got a lot going on, and for a collector posing everything on the shelf, the somewhat lackluster legs shouldn’t be an issue. However… The title of the category is Articulation/Playability… And I’ll be honest. Fresh out of the package, I play around with my toys for a few minutes, generally. I like to just mess with them and get a feel for them. I feel severely limited playing around with Basic figures. It’s not horrible by any means, but the legs bring the overall score down a lot. That 7 was generous on my part, because I’m still so impressed with the figure overall.Paint: 8/10Like I said, unless it’s a very noticeable issue, paint isn’t generally a big deal to me. I’m only gonna be looking at it from afar generally, and even when it’s close up, it’s not like anyone else is going to complain that MY toys have shoddy paint. That said, the paint on my Del Rio is pretty solid. This is a line that, though appealing to collectors and adults, is intended for children first and foremost. If Mattel wanted to give all of these things really crappy paint they could and nobody would stop them, because kids are gonna play with and ruin them anyway. However, Mattel recognizes their adult fanbase, and tends to deliver in the paint department. There are only a few, very miniscule blunders that I noticed. Some white flecks from his trunks have appeared on his thighs, and on his (Pardon my language) ass, there are a few very small spots where the paint has rubbed off. Basically, two very small, unimportant details that you’re not gonna notice unless you’re really really looking hard, like I was for this review.</p><p>If you can’t read what’s on the picture, the paint issues were so miniscule I couldn’t accurately photograph them! So enjoy ADR enzuigiri-ing Faker!Also, his shoulder tattoos are perfectly painted; Again impressive for such a small, miniscule detail. In terms of color, etc, I’ll give you a run down: Black hair, brownish skin, white trunks, white boots, white wristbands, white kneepads. Except for the back of his trunks, everything white is surprisingly impeccable. I really can’t complain. I only gave it an 8 because, with all of that white, the figure sort of has a bland look to it, and doesn’t really POP.Accessories: N/ABasic figures come with zilch in terms of accessories. I pose him with the Elite WWE Championship from my Sheamus, but Del Rio obviously didn’t come with that.</p><p>I can’t really rank it, and you don’t buy Basic figs expecting accessories, so it’s hardly a detriment.FUN Value: 9/10This is pretty much a combination of Articulation and Sculpt. Will you have fun messing with and looking at this figure? I emphatically say YES. I bought it a few weeks ago, and I had a lot of fun looking at it now just for this write up. The picture taking was fun too!</p><p>Hordak gets a kick too! FUN!</p><p>How did Hordak get himself into this one?! If you like MOTU, WWE, read this site, and found this funny, you don’t exist.It’s a damn near flawless figure. The only reason Del Rio doesn’t have a 10 here is because those legs really bug me. The upper bodies are so packed and poseable, and then we just get these sort of “blah” legs. You’ll still have a lot of fun just marveling in how Mattel could possibly create something of quality this high in a mass produced figure, though.OVERALL: 8.5/10Simple version: This figure is awesome. Del Rio’s not my favorite wrestler by any means, but I can’t deny that this is simply the greatest figure Mattel has put out so far. The perfect sculpt and, really, just beautiful look of the figure really make it worth your time and money.</p><p>However, I have this quirk… If I KNOW I can find something in a store for a certain price, I simply won’t buy it online. I struck gold finding this figure. It was at some random ToysRUs in Philly. I’m glad I did though, because this figure is great, and if I hadn’t found it in the store, I would’ve gladly paid twice what it’s worth to get it online. It really is that good.Well, thanks for reading! If you wanna reach me, talk about toys, or wrestling, my email is hahahahawhy@yahoo.com and I also have a Facebook for wrestling related matters, “NoDQ Geddy Cahoon.” Friend me to talk about toys, articles, wrestling, whatever. I’d also like to thank Eric Kanes for giving me the opportunity to do these reviews. It probably sounds like I’m kissing ass, but whatever. I’m passionate about wrestling and action figures, so writing about the two is a blast. I’m thinking reviews will typically be up Thursdays, for those interested! Until next time, let’s all keep collecting action figures well past the age during which it is generally considered socially acceptable!</p>
