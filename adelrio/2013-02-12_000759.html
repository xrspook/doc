Wade Barrett</strong></p><p>The fans had the choice to vote for either a No DQ match or a 2 Out Of 3 falls match. I voted for 2 out of 3 falls. Everyone else voted for no DQ, proving that nobody likes me.</p><p>Wade Barrett had a surprising amount of crowd support in his entrance, cutting a promo on why we should acknowledge his presence. He called Louisville a Hell hole and said that he’d be leaving it as the first ever English World Heavyweight Champion . A single Indian tear flowed down my cheek for William Regal.</p><p>Del Rio’s reaction was less than huge considering the way people react to him on SmackDown. I thought he’d get an Eddie pop, but it was alright. I popped for more Ricardo Rodriguez than anything. The match had a decent start, with a lot of technical wrestling and finisher attempts. The first weapon introduced was the kendo stick, which Barrett beat the hell out of Del Rio with.</p><p>Wade Barrett left the ring and grabbed a chair, then headed in and started smashing the shit out of Del Rio with it. They went back and forth for a while, with Del Rio getting the kendo stick, Barrett hitting the swinging sidewalk slam, and attempting Wasteland only to have it reversed. When Barrett tried to leave, Del Rio kicked him in the back and then gave him a Backstabber. At this point, I got up and went down to ringside to get better pictures. Security pretty much farted in response because the show was almost over. After Wade Barrett set up a table in hopes of putting Del Rio through it, Ricardo hit him over the head with a bucket and then Del Rio gave Barrett a bulldog through the table from the top rope, retaining the World Heavyweight Championship.</p></blockquote><p>转载自：</p><p><a href="http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42842048465/match-7-no-disqualification-match-for-the-world">http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42842048465/match-7-no-disqualification-match-for-the-world</a></p><p><a href="http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42842407807/match-7-no-disqualification-match-for-the-world">http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42842407807/match-7-no-disqualification-match-for-the-world</a></p><p><a href="http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42842529501/and-finally-a-shot-i-got-of-world-heavyweight">http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42842529501/and-finally-a-shot-i-got-of-world-heavyweight</a></p><p><a href="http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42805886425/jasonfnsaint-me-and-ricardo-rodriguez-if">http://shitloadsofwrestling.tumblr.com/post/42805886425/jasonfnsaint-me-and-ricardo-rodriguez-if</a></p></p><p>shitloadsofwrestling: And finally, a shot I got of World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio just as he made his exit. Shortly afterward, I got a photo with Ricardo Rodriguez. I went home a happy boy.</p><p>jasonfnsaint: Me and Ricardo Rodriguez. If anyone wants to know if I still mark out…. the answer is yes. Definitely, yes.^ That was taken about an hour ago at the WWE house show in Louisville, KY. I have a ton of pics I’ll be sharing soon, including a bunch of Fandangooooooo! Stay tuned, kids.</p>
