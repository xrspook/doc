In the end, Paul Heyman was able to help Brock Lesnar survive and get the victory. Last night saw the crowning of a new WWE Champion and during the celebration . . . we saw the crowning of a new WWE Champion when Randy Orton cashed in his briefcase, with a little help from his friends. The situation is showing its Evolution, but will Daniel Bryan be able to evolve into a position where he can regain his WWE Championship?</p><p>We are in Anaheim, California and your announcers are Michael ‘In the land of Mickey Mouse’ Cole, Jerry ‘Is Total Divas the new O.C.’ Lawler, and John ‘Ring of Mouse Ears’ Layfield.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio versus Sin Cara in a Non Title Match</strong></p><p>Del Rio with a kick and punches followed by a boot to the back. Del Rio tries for a hip toss to the floor but Cara bounces off the ropes and he sends Del Rio to the floor with an arm drag. Sin Cara with a suicide dive and they bump heads.</p><p>Del Rio rolls Cara into the ring while the medical staff checks on him. The referee calls for the bell.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio (by referee stoppage)</p><p>After the match, Del Rio tries to get a few shots in on Sin Cara.</p><p>After the match, Del Rio gets the mic and he says that he proved at SummerSlam why he is the best World Champion in history. Most important, he proved to the Latino community that finally you have someone to cheer for.</p><p>The Latinos have no heroes so he will be the representative for everyone, especially all of the peasants.</p><p>Ricardo Rodriguez comes out and he asks Alberto if he remembers him. Alberto was talking about being a hero, but Alberto is not a hero to him, the people or the Latino community. Ricardo says that he has a confession. He is very happy that he doesn’t have to represent Alberto any more and stand by his side.</p><p>In fact, he is proud that he represents someone new. Somebody who will stand for people. Rob Van Dam.</p><p>Van Dam and Del Rio fight in the ring and Van Dam with a thrust kick and he goes up top but Del Rio goes to the floor.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=79726">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=79726</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
