                            <h1>WWE Raw 2014-04-21 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2014-04-22 15:26:45+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2014, raw, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE RAW REPORT: DANIEL BRYAN RETURNS; THE SHIELD CHALLENGE EVOLUTION; FANS VOTE FOR CENA'S OPPONENT; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2014-04-21 23:00:00</p><p>We begin this week’s show with a look at the Almost Everyone in the Locker Room versus The Shield match that was a pretext for the return of Evolution.</p><p>We take a look at the return to the ring for Evolution after The Shield had to face 11 men.</p><p>A limo arrives at the Arena and Evolution emerges.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Evolution makes their way to the ring</p><p>Hunter says that he laughs every time he thinks about it. Imagine what it feels like. You tell the whole world that you are the baddest guys on the planet week in and week out. Then one day, your daddy comes out and spanks you in front of the world. That is humiliating and humbling. That is just the beginning.</p><p>Orton says that it takes just a single spark to set the world on fire. It was one careless act by the Shield that set the gears of their destruction. The reformation of the most dominant and most feared group . . . Evolution.</p><p>We have a video package for Evolution.</p><p>Batista asks if you are starting to get it now. Thirty-one world titles in the ring between the three of them. The Shield has absolutely no idea what they have gotten themselves into. He tells them to deal with that.</p><p>The Shield’s music plays and they make their way through the crowd and to ringside.</p><p>Evolution shows how powerful they are by leaving the ring while The Shield enter the ring.</p><p>Dean says last week wasn’t the first time they were beaten up and won’t be the last. He tells them well done. Dean has a question for Hunter. Do they look humbled to him?</p><p>DO WE LOOK HUMBLE TO YOU? There was a reason why they were hired to protect him and the creampuff next to him. The Shield are the meanest, nastiest, and dirtiest animals. They are angry.</p><p>Seth says that they have every right to be angry because of what happened last week. It was them and 12 other guys. For Batista to say that they have no idea what they have gotten themselves into, they are the ones who started it.</p><p>They stand on the stage in their suits, but they don’t want to fight. They talk about how powerful they are and how they were built for dominance. In two weeks, they will come face to face with the Hounds of Justice and it will be war. When they have nowhere to run, will they be looking out for each other? Randy Orton will be looking out for himself. Batista has his Hollywood obligations. Triple H will do what he always does. He will do ‘what’s best for the boss’.</p><p>What you are looking at is the most dominant force in the history of this company. In two weeks they will rip them apart and the reunion will come to an abrupt halt. When they made the match, they put a nail in their own coffin. They will be the hammer that drives it home.</p><p>Roman says last week, they were given an ultimatum. This week they will give them one. In a few moments, they will drop their mics and come up the ramp to kick their asses. They have two options. They can be men and try to fight him, or you can be creampuffs and cower away and hide.</p><p>The Shield go up the ramp but the 11 men who started things for Evolution last week.</p><p>Hunter says there is an option three. In life, you either adapt or you perish. That is Evolution.<br></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/article/85162/wwe-raw-report-daniel-bryan-returns-the-shield-challenge-evolution-fans-vote-for-cenas-opponent-and-more.html?p=1">http://pwinsider.com/article/85162/wwe-raw-report-daniel-bryan-returns-the-shield-challenge-evolution-fans-vote-for-cenas-opponent-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2014-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2014</a></p>
