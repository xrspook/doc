Interesting to note they spent a lot of time pushing The Rock's return as well.</p><p><strong>WWE Intercontinental champion Kofi Kingston vs. Alberto De Rio</strong></p><p>Del Rio turned his attention to Kofi Kingston, calling him trash and saying Kingston can’t stop destiny. Kingston’s music started, cutting off Del Rio from completing his rant.</p><p>They locked up and Kingston backed Del Rio into the turnbuckles but Del Rio slipped out of the ropes to force a break. There was a sizeable chant for Del Rio early. Del Rio called for Ricardo and when the ref stopped Del Rio’s announcer, Del Rio grabbed Kingston and rudely slammed him over. Kingston slipped out of a tiltowhirl backbreaker and dropkicked Del Rio, who escaped to the floor to cut off Kingston’s momentum.</p><p>Kingston followed to the floor and kicked Alberto while he was down. He deposited Del Rio back into the ring and followed suit with a series of right hands and forearms. Kingston charged Del Rio but was backdropped over the ropes. Kingston landed on his feet but was knocked off the apron to the floor when Del Rio shoulderblocked him into the ringpost.. Del Rio grabbed the Intercontinental champ and whipped him into the ring steps, then tossed him back into the ring for a two count, Del Rio locked in a submission but Kingston refused to tap.</p><p>Del Rio continued the assault on Kingston, beating Kingston with punches as he held him down. Del Rio nailed a nice belly to back suplex for another near fall. He scissored Kingston’s body and squeezed, trying to work Kingston down. Kingston fought back and came off the ropes with a nice forearm for a near fall. Kinbgston and Del Rio fought back and forth until Kofi drilled Del Rio with several double chops and a dropkick. Kingston nailed the Boom Drop and began setting up for Trouble in Paradise. He went for it but Del Rio ducked the kick. Kingston missed a splash in the corner but used the ropes for momentum to kick Del Rio in the head.</p><p>Kingston came off the ropes with a flying bodypress but Del Rio pulled his knees up as they connected, changing the tide of the match immediately. Del Rio scored several near falls and went for a superplex but Kingston fought him off. Kingston nailed a missile dropkick for a two count. Del Rio caught Kingston with several strikes to the ribs and scored another near fall.</p><p>Kingston countered a move into a DDT but Ricardo Rodriquez distracted the referee, who missed the initial cover.

Kingston slipped out and nailed a kick to the head for a two count. Kingston went for a diving attack in the corner but missed and was nailed by Del Rio.</p><p>Del Rio locked on the rolling armbreaker but Kofi locked his fingers to prevent Del Rio from torquing the arm. Del Rio beat on Kofi until he let go. Alberto locked in the move and Kofi, after failing to reach the ropes, finally tapped.</p><p>Your winner, Alberto Del Rio!</p><p>Real good back and forth opener.</p><p>After the match, Alberto Del Rio attacked Edge in the Chamber and locked on the rolling armbar as a number of referees tried to break him up. Christian's music hit and he made his return, "saving" his best friend. Christian attacked Del Rio and worked him over. Christian ran Del Rio's shoulder into the corner. The referees tried to hold him back but he broke free and nailed the Unprettier before walking off. Christian doesn't check on Edge?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/55411/complete-wwe-elimination-chamber-report-wrestlemania-main-events-set-lots-of-returns-brutal-chamber-matches-new-tag-champs-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/55411/complete-wwe-elimination-chamber-report-wrestlemania-main-events-set-lots-of-returns-brutal-chamber-matches-new-tag-champs-and-more.html?p=1</a></p>
