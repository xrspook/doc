Then we move ahead to Edge’s comments from this Monday’s Raw when he announced his retirement. What will happen when Edge forfeits his title?</p><p>We are live on tape from Albany, New York and your announcers are Michael ‘I want to be like William Regal when I grow up’ Booker ‘I will buy the next bottle of shampoo’ T, and Josh ‘Babysitting Michael Cole since 2010’ Mathews.</p><p>Tony Chimmel introduces Ricardo Rodriguez so he can introduce Alberto Del Rio. Alberto drives into the arena in a new vehicle.</p><p>Alberto gets the mic and he reminds us who he is, but tonight is not about him. It is about somebody else. Last Monday on Raw, when Edge announced his retirement the entire locker room and the WWE Universe lost a hero. When he thinks about Edge, he thinks about respect. In his thirteen years in WWE, he held more titles than anyone else. Now he is giving up on everything in this incredible business. Alberto says that he cannot imagine how Edge feels right now.</p><p>This was his life. It was his passion. It was his love. Alberto says that even though it was his destiny to be the World Champion, he did not want it to happen this way. Since Alberto says that since Edge is here to surrender the World Title, and because he earned the number one contender spot, Edge should come out right now and present him with the World Title.</p><p>Alberto waits for Edge to come out to give him the title and the fans chant for Edge.</p><p>Instead of Edge, Smackdown General Manager Teddy Long makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Alberto and Teddy shake hands and Teddy tells Alberto that he is sorry to disappoint him because it is not going to go down the way that Alberto suggested. No one is presenting Alberto with anything.</p><p>Teddy agrees with Alberto that he is the number one contender. He says that Alberto has earned the right to wrestle for the title at Extreme Rules in a Ladder Match. That is what Alberto is going to do. We will find out who Alberto faces and it will be determined in a twenty man battle royal.</p><p>Alberto wants to know what Teddy is talking about. Alberto says that he should be the champion. Alberto says that this is a conspiracy. Alberto says that he never liked Teddy.</p><p>Teddy tells Alberto that is how they roll on Smackdown. Alberto tells Teddy that he is glad that he hurt Edge. Alberto says that he is glad that he is the man who forced Edge to retire. It was Edge’s destiny to end up like a crippled coward. Alberto says that it is also his destiny to be the World Champion.</p><p>Teddy cuts Alberto off and tells him it is his destiny to shut up.</p><p>We are back and Edge is in the back with Rosa Mendes and she is talking to him in Spanish. Edge says that he has no idea what she said but she had him at ‘quiero’. Rosa says that everyone is going to miss Edge for everything that he has done for the business. She cannot imagine not seeing him again.</p><p>Edge turns around and Alberto Del Rio is behind him. Alberto looks at Edge and he offers his hand. Edge thinks about it but he walks away.</p><p>We see the title belt at ringside and Alberto Del Rio is standing by it as he watches to see who will be his opponent at Extreme Rules.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Number One Contender Battle Royal</strong></p><p>The participants in the battle royal are Big Show, Kane, Justin Gabriel, Heath Slater, Jack Swagger, Wade Barrett, Brodus Clay, Christian, Ezekiel Jackson, Cody Rhodes, Drew McIntyre, Yoshi Tatsu, Kofi Kingston, Rey Mysterio, Tyler Reks, Chris Masters, Chavo Guerrero, Curt Hawkins, Trent Barreta, and JTG</p><p>The bell rings and everyone goes after someone and we see a lot of punching and kicking, but JTG is eliminated first.
