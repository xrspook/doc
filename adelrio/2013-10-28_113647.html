Alberto Del Rio to capture World Heavyweight Championship</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>October 27, 2013</p><p></p><p></p><p>MIAMI – The Champ is back! At WWE Hell in a Cell, John Cena made a triumphant return from injury, overcoming a brutal onslaught to capture the World Heavyweight Championship from Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>The emotional pay-per-view comeback of Cena absolutely ignited the WWE Universe. From the early moments of the subsequent matchup, however, it quickly became apparent that Del Rio’s volatile mentions of aggression would threaten that homecoming and, in fact, the very career of his celebrated opposition – as he had done to so many competitors since debuting in WWE in 2010.</p><p>Indeed, the treacherous titleholder would target the injured arm of his heroic No. 1 contender with excruciating results from the word go. And despite Cena’s consistent resilience and ability to roar back from his opponent’s unrelenting assault, it seemed for a time as if the 13-time World Champion had indeed reemerged too early and was not 100%. With each passing moment, Del Rio executed a calculating attack, designed to wear down his prey.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125">http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125</a></p><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>The resilient challenger would soon build a solid offense, catching Del Rio with a drop kick as his opponent came off the top rope and following up with the five-knuckle shuffle for a near near-fall.</p><p>But, as the two determined warriors battled back-and-forth with growing intensity, the fans couldn’t help but wonder just how much punishment Cena would be able to take.</p><p>Then, in a critical moment, Cena avoided a Del Rio charge, sending the Mexican Champion directly into the unforgiving steel post and allowed his foe to hit a follow-up high cross body.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125/page-2</a></p><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Regaining the advantage, Del Rio would try the Cross Armbreaker, only to have that attempt countered with the feared STF. Still, the champion managed to persevere by getting two fingers on the ropes and force the referee to break the hold.</p><p>At wasn’t long before Del Rio would return to his signature maneuver, this time successfully locking in the Cross Armbreaker. But even as he rolled down Cena’s protective pad to expose the injury, the incredible strength of the Cenation Leader allowed him to pick up the reigning champion and miraculously drive him down into the canvas.</p><p>And when the stunned Essence of Excellence regained to advantage and went for his dreaded submission hold yet again, Cena would be ready for him – countering with an incredible Attitude Adjustment to grab the monumental three-count to earn Cena the World Heavyweight Title amidst a standing ovation!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125/page-3">http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125/page-3</a></p><blockquote><p></p><p>Returning from elbow surgery to repair a torn triceps, the determined Leader of the Cenation stepped back into action with 13-time World Championships to his credit – including a record 11 reigns as WWE Champion as well as a two World Heavyweight Titles.</p><p>But, in the weeks leading up to the pay-per-view showdown created by SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, the 4-time World Champion, Alberto Del Rio set out to prove that Cena’s best days were in fact behind him – vowing to destroy his celebrated opponent by locking him in the Cross Armbreaker and never letting go.</p><p>As vicious as the intent of the Mexican titleholder was, though, it would not be enough to deny the intestinal fortitude of a true WWE institution. And now that Cena had left WWE Hell in a Cell a 14-time World Champion, one thing is for sure, The Champ is definitely here!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125/page-4">http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2013/del-rio-vs-john-cena-26154125/page-4</a></p>
