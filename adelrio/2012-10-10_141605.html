You must refresh the page for the latest updates.</p><p>The Smackdown commentary this week appears to be Josh Mathews and JBL. JBL came out to a pretty small reaction, but the males were pumped up. Josh offered up a handshake, but JBL slapped his hand away. Hilarious!</p><p>Alberto Del Rio beat Daniel Bryan. Del Rio won by submission with the cross arm breaker. ADR talked smack about Orton after the match. Orton showed up and started beating down ADR. Ricardo provided a distraction for ADR to escape, so Randy RKO'd him through the announce table as ADR looked on.</p><p>After the cameras stopped filming, Big Show came out in sweats and told Orton to go away. Instead, Randy attacked him. ADR came back out to make it 2-on-1 before Sheamus came out to even it up. ADR took a Brogue Kick and Show took an RKO to send the fans home happy.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article10027761.shtml">http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article10027761.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SECOND SET OF SMACKDOWN TAPING SPOILERS FROM SAN JOSE, CA</strong></p><p>By Sean Campbell on 2012-10-10 08:43:45</p><p>Pretty decent show again tonight. Surprisingly small crowd, the entire top bowl was closed and probably two thirds of the camera side was empty. Everyone was really into the show though, staying active for pretty much everything.</p><p>Main Event of Smackdown: Daniel Bryan v. Alberto Del Rio - Bryan taps out to the Cross Arm Breaker. Afterwards, Del Rio starts running down Randy Orton, railing on the fact he isn't there after the beatdowns from the past couple shows. As Del Rio starts mocking Orton's mannerisms again, surprise, out from under the ring he comes and a brawl kicks off. Del Rio narrowly escaped and left poor Ricardo to take a RKO on top of the announcer's table.</p><p>Post-Smackdown wasn't much. Big Show comes down (again...) in a sweatsuit, saying he wants to talk to the audience and set some things straight, so Orton needs to leave his ring. Of course this starts another brawl, with Del Rio joining in and Sheamus running down to even the odds. A quick Brogue Kick and RKO ends the scuffle and the crowd goes home happy.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=72538">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=72538</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
