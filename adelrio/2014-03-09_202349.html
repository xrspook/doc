Amazing match with plenty of false finishes. This is awesome chants broke out. Your typical Ziggler Del Rio match two great workers.</p><p>Only two CM Punk chants broke out. One at the start of the show and the second was at HHH during his match.</p><p>Biggest pops 1. Bryan 2. Cena 3. Usos</p><p>Most heat 1. Ryback 2. Ryback 3. Literally Ryback was the only one booed. Weird and young crowd tonight.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0309/572017/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0309/572017/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>3/8 WWE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN LIVE REPORT</strong></p><p>By Mike Johnson on 2014-03-09 00:04:56</p><p>WWE returned to Madison Square Garden in NYC tonight for their final house show in the venue before Wrestlemania 30. It was very much a show where you didn’t feel like anything major went down and the wrestling was OK, but there was nothing memorable when the show was over. Usually the MSG shows “feel” like a step up from the normal WWE live event, but tonight it just felt like another night at the office with guys doing enough but not going out of their way to break out of the pack. It didn’t feel like Wrestlemania was around the bend, that is for sure.</p><p>That said, the majority of the audience there seemed to be young children and their family and they were easily the loudest and most into the show, specifically for the entrances and cheering for the heroes. In that aspect, WWE delivered.</p><p>There were several instances of chanting for CM Punk but other than the Miz vs. Justin Gabriel match nothing was extremely loud or lengthy. Lots of Punk merchandise in the crowd and WWE was selling different shirts and other Punk merchandise.</p><p>Dolph Ziggler pinned Alberto Del Rio with the Zig Zag. A nice reaction for Ziggler coming out. A solid back and forth match. Del Rio went for the armbar at the end but Ziggler slipped out and nailed the finisher. At one point, Del Rio hopped over the rail and faced off with a fan that was jawing with him. The crowd was much more into Ziggler than you'd expect given his placement on the roster.</p><p>Notes: It was a healthy crowd but nowhere near a sellout. Scattered empty seats all over the place….CM Punk shirts and other merchandise were being sold at the venue….They return on 7/12. There is an ongoing pre-sale right now using code WWEGARDEN….One of the biggest pops of the night was for a photo of Hulk Hogan that was shown on the video screens as WWE had rotating photos from recent events interspersed with texts and tweets from fans….Justin Roberts did the ring announcing. This is the part of the article where I say it is completely stupid not to have Howard Finkel ring announcing in MSG.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=84127">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=84127</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SHOW RESULTS - 3/8 WWE in NYC at MSG: Wild tag main event of Cena & Batista vs. Orton & Wyatt, Triple H plays up Bryan feud, Stephanie surprise appearance, more</strong></p><p>Mar 9, 2014 - 12:18:54 AM</p><p>WWE Live show results; March 8, 2014; New York City at Madison Square Garden</p><p>Report by Mike Omansky, PWTorch correspondent</p><p>Estimated crowd: 14,000-15,000 range (a few sections unsold, but big crowd). ... Return date announced: Sat., July 12. Presale now through March 18 through Ticketmaster with the pre-sale code WWEGARDEN.</p><p>Very good show, overall. And, a great “first run” main event tag match of John Cena & Batista vs. Randy Orton & Bray Wyatt, where Batista dumped Cena and Wyatt dumped Orton, allowing Cena to win in the end.</p><p>(7) Dolph Ziggler beat Alberto Del Rio. Ziggler scored the pin with a Zig-Zag after a good back and forth match and a number of nearfalls for each. Typical outing for these two as far as moves go, and very hard kicks from Del Rio. (*1/2)</p><p>Overall, excellent main event – unusual pairings to begin with. First-rate match and Wyatt showed that he can be, at least in the short-term, and interesting opponent for Cena; but more important, can hang with Cena and Batista, and convincingly beat them up.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_76877.shtml">http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article_76877.shtml</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2014-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2014</a></p>
