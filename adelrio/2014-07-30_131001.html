Then he will teach Seth a lesson about selling out.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio makes his way to the stage. He wants to know what exactly is Dean supposed to be. Is he a rat or a dog? He looks like a bum who came out of a dumpster. He needs to stop worrying about Seth Rollins and start worrying about Alberto Del Rio. Alberto says that he is not afraid.
