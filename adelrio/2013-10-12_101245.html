Then we see what happened to Triple H at the end of the night.</p><p>We are in Columbus, Ohio and your announcers are John ‘Buckeye’ Layfield and Michael ‘Blue Jacket’ Cole.</p><p>Vickie Guerrero comes to the ring and we see Alberto Del Rio doing his best to suck up to Vickie on Raw and Vickie rejecting his advances when he turned his back. Then we see the announcement that Alberto will be facing John Cena at Hell in a Cell.</p><p>Vickie says on Raw everyone witnessed the most heinous atrocity in the history of the WWE. The COO of the WWE was struck by the Big Show. The Big Show tried to compromise the main event of Battleground. He should have been fired a long time ago.</p><p>While all of you thought the situation was hilarious, the problems for the Big Show have just begun. There is a For Sale sign in front of Big Show’s house and he is unemployed. Big Show deserves . . .</p><p>Alberto Del Rio interrupts Vickie and he comes to the ring. Alberto asks Vickie to reconsider. He does not want to have to defend the title against John Cena.</p><p>Vickie tells Alberto that him versus John Cena is what is best for business. The name of the pay per view is Hell in a Cell.</p><p>Alberto says that this is not fair. There has got to be something to make Vickie change her mind.</p><p>Vickie thinks about it. She asks Alberto if it was true what he said about her when he said she was sexy?</p><p>Alberto says every single word he said was true.</p><p>Vickie tells Alberto if he wants her to reconsider, she tells Alberto to kiss her.</p><p>Alberto kisses Vickie on the cheek but Vickie wants him to kiss her on the lips. Alberto hesitates but he does what Vickie wants. Vickie tells Alberto to put a little something into the kiss. Alberto puts a little more passion into the kiss.</p><p>Vickie tells Alberto to do it like the French. Maybe he can kiss her some other place, like her rear end (as Vickie points to her rear end). She says that she will not reconsider.</p><p>Damien Sandow’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Damien says that he interrupts this matter for some breaking news. Alberto Del Rio is a phony. Damien tells Vickie that Alberto sees her as a sex object that he thinks he can manipulate. Damien says that Vickie is beautiful but he appreciates her intelligence. Alberto is out here begging not to be put in a match with John Cena because he knows that he will lose. Just like he would beg Vickie not to let him cash in his Money in the Bank contract.</p><p>Alberto’s conduct and mere presence in the ring is not befitting of a champion. Damien will show that he is the better man when given the opportunity.</p><p>Vickie says that he wondered what would happen when these two men face off in the ring. Damien will not have to cash in his briefcase and Alberto will not have to put the title on the line.</p><p>Alberto hits Sandow with the mic and he attacks Sandow. Sandow runs Alberto into the corner and then he grabs his case and Del Rio leaves the ring.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio versus Damien Sandow in a Non Title Match</strong></p><p>Sandow with a kick and forearm.

Del Rio sends Sandow into the turnbuckles and then he goes for the step up enzuigiri but Sandow back body drops Del Rio over the top rope to the floor.</p><p>Sandow sends Del Rio back into the ring and he connects with a knee drop and an elbow drop for a near fall.
