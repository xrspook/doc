Bryan spoke of this Sunday’s match as representative of a potential “paradigm shift”; Cena said it’d be the submission specialist’s chance to define his legacy.</p><p>“This championship is reserved for moments like John Cena vs. The Rock, but this Sunday, will Daniel Bryan define himself as the next Rock, or as the next John Cena?” the Cenation leader asked. “Or, simply, is Daniel Bryan good enough to define himself as the first Daniel Bryan? That’s what this Sunday is about.”</p><p>In addition to the WWE Title Match participants, the WWE Universe heard from CM Punk, World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio and the cast of “Total Divas,” as well as WWE Executive Vice President of Creative Stephanie McMahon and WWE Executive Vice President of Talent and Live Events Paul “Triple H” Levesque.</p><p>McMahon spoke about the many community events that Superstars and Divas are taking part in this week throughout the Los Angeles area, including Be a STAR anti-bullying rallies and the Superstars for Hope red carpet party, which benefits Make-A-Wish. With SummerSlam set to broadcast on numerous digital platforms, The Biggest Party of the Summer is also slated to be the biggest social media event of the season, she said.</p><p>Triple H guaranteed the WWE Universe that this Sunday’s pay-per-view will be an “epic” event, calling attention to the Cena vs. Bryan match, in particular.</p><p>“It is a match that I think has bigger implications than just the WWE Championship,” said Triple H, who will also serve as the bout’s guest referee. “It is a match [between] arguably the face of WWE, the stalworth John Cena, against what many feel is the future of WWE, the rising tide, the new era ... Daniel Bryan. I cannot tell you how much I look forward to watching that match.”</p><p>Keep with WWE.com throughout the week to follow all of the activities surrounding The Biggest Party of the Summer. Plus, to catch all of the action, be sure to tune in to the free, hour-long SummerSlam Kickoff this Sunday at 7 ET/4 PT, as well as the pay-per-view, which begins at 8 ET/5 PT.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2013/first-ever-summerslam-press-conference-26140007">http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2013/first-ever-summerslam-press-conference-26140007</a></p>
