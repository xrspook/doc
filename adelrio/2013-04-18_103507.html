                            <h1>WWE Supershow House Show 2013-03-31 White Plains New York 网友抓拍</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-04-18 10:35:07+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点图片</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, smackdown, wade_barrett, chris_jericho, the_miz, fandango, jack_swagger, house_show, white_plains</p><hr><p><blockquote><p>It’s been a while since WWE has rolled around my neck of the woods. With this event about a half hour away from me, I decided to try and get some tickets. This was my first ever live event and I will say this: it was phenomenal for me. Lots of fun, excitement, cheering, buying merch, and more!</p><p>Little bit of backstory: The event took place in the Westchester County Center, an arena from about the 1930s that seats roughly 5,000 people. A 5,000 seat arena means you’re practically guaranteed a great view which I certainly was. A recommendation if you go to this arena; try to get seats in the balcony or the floor. They’re pretty much the best seats there.</p><p>All right, now the doors open at 4:30 pm for the show at 6 pm. Got to the arena at about 5 and it was starting to get a bit crowded. When you walked in, they had a green screen where you can take a picture holding a WWE Title. Skipped that and went to look at the merchandise stand which was ridiculously packed. Skipped that and just went to buy some food and drinks. Waited and waited and finally, Tony Chimel, I believe, who came out and asked us to stand for the National Anthem. After that, the opening match began:</p><p><strong>10 Man Battle Royale; Winner faces Alberto Del Rio Later On</strong></p><p>Out first was 3MB followed by the rest of the participants: Antonio Cesaro, Wade Barrett, Kofi Kingston, R-Truth, the Miz, Kane, and finally Daniel Bryan. Kofi, Bryan, and Kane got big reactions especially Daniel Bryan and the “YES!” chants. The usual brawl broke out and the first man to be eliminated was R-Truth. After Truth, Kofi eliminated Cesaro who went back and eliminated Kofi as revenge. Soon after, the trio of 3MB was eliminated leaving Bryan, Kane, and Barrett left.</p><p><strong>Wade Barrett vs Alberto Del Rio in a Champion vs Champion match</strong></p><p>I originally thought this match was for Del Rio’s title; guess I was wrong. Barrett came out a little reaction, but the usual boos. Del Rio came out to a huge pop and was extremely over. Barrett and Del Rio fought for a bit with Barrett even going after Ricardo at one point only to catch a baseball slide from Del Rio. Del Rio hit 9 forearm shots to Barrett’s back when he was tied in the ropes followed by a back cracker. While calling for the cross armbreaker, Jack Swagger ran in and started attacking Del Rio.</p><p>A two on one assault until Miz came and evened the odds. Miz started fighting to no avail as he got whupped and dumped out the ring. Then the arena got dark….”BREAK THE WALLS DOWN!” rang out and Chris Jericho came to clear the ring. Huge “Y2J!! chants came out for Jericho. Then some familiar dance music was heard and out came FAN….DAN….GOOOOOO with a different dance partner.</p><p>Jericho jumped out of the ring and went after Fandango quickly. Meanwhile in the ring, Miz was fighting Barrett and Del Rio with Swagger. Eventually the heels got sent running while he faces posed in the ring. Vickie Guerrero came out to universal boos as expected. She makes an official 6 man tag match: Jericho, Del Rio, and Miz vs Barrett, Swagger, and Fandango.</p><p>*<em>Chris Jericho, Alberto Del Rio, and The Miz vs Wade Barrett, Jack Swagger, and Fandango </em>*</p><p>Besides the main event, this was definitely the hottest match of the night. Del Rio and Jericho got massive pops and cheers from the crowd the whole match (Si and Y2J was all you could hear). Fandango did some posing in the beginning before Jericho took the fight to him. Swagger got tagged in and and fought with Jericho before Miz was tagged in. The two of them fought for a bit before Swagger got control after Barrett dropped Miz from the ring apron.</p><p>Barrett held control before Miz hit his backbreaker into a neckbreaker combo and both men tagged out. In came Jericho and Fandango with Jericho keeping control, hitting the Lionsault, and locking in the Walls of Jericho. That got broken up, Swagger got tagged in and kept Jericho from getting to his corner. Fandango came in, attacked Jericho, danced over him, then went up for his diving leg drop.</p><p>Jericho shook the ropes and both men tagged in their partners: Del Rio and Swagger. Del Rio hit his finishing sequence and locked in the cross arm breaker. Fandango broke it up only for Jericho to run in and hit the CodeBreaker on him. Del Rio hit his step-up corner enzuigiri on Swagger then Barrett and Miz got tagged in. Winds of Change by Barrett followed by a missed Bullhammer. Miz locked in the Figure 4 leglock for the win. An uber fun and ridiculously over match for the crowd. Fandango was damn hilarious since he danced, wiggled his butt, and was just goofy throughout the whole match.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>An overall fantastic event that was well worth the time and money. I had a blast, picked up some merchandise (program, Jericho/Rock/”I was there” shirts), and it was just a great experience that I will definitely do again in the future. Funny story: I was wearing an NWO shirt, some lady noticed my shirt and said “NWO for life, my brother.” The most over guys were: Cena, Orton, Sheamus, Ryback, Kofi, and Del Rio. The heels didn’t get huge boos except for Shield, Heyman, and Vickie. In closing, I recommend going to a live event when you can and just enjoy the experience.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestleenigma.com/wwe-road-to-wrestlemania-tour-recap-review-some-thoughts-from-the-march-31st-live-event-from-white-plains-ny">http://www.wrestleenigma.com/wwe-road-to-wrestlemania-tour-recap-review-some-thoughts-from-the-march-31st-live-event-from-white-plains-ny</a></p></p>
