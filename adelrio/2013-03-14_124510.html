Alberto says that he has a big smile on his face because he is going to show us something really funny. His opponent at Wrestlemania, Jack Swagger claims to be the only ‘real American’. He tells Jackie that there are a lot of people in Fort Wayne, Indiana and other places in this nation who are from a different country. In the end, we are all made in America.</p><p>Of course Jack Swagger’s comments are hurtful and demeaning, but to be honest, they are really funny some times. He wants to show us what he means.</p><p>We see the video that aired on last week’s Smackdown and re-aired on Raw.</p><p>Alberto says that was funny, but now he has to get down to business because he has a really big opponent. He faces . . .</p><p>Big Show makes his way to the ring for the match.</p><p><strong>Match Number One: Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez) versus Big Show</strong></p><p>They lock up and Show sends Del Rio to the mat.

Del Rio with punches but Show with a shoulder tackle. Showwith an elbow to the arm and Show with an arm bar as he continues to work on the elbow and shoulder.

It looks like we're cutting straight to the chase, as Ricardo Rodriguez announces Alberto Del Rio. That's how I like to start an episode of Main Event. Aw, he grabbed a mic.</p><p>He says that he's going to show us something funny before almost botching the name of the town they're in. He says that while Swagger's words are hurtful and demeaning, they're really funny sometimes. He shoots us to... the same video they showed us on Smackdown? K. Here comes the Big Show. Lets get this damn match going.</p><p>Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio (w/ Ricardo Rodriguez)</p><p>Here we go! These guys are physical right out of the gate. Alberto hits an assisted lung blower off of the second rope as Jack Swagger strolls down the ramp!</p><p>Big Show's delivering the overhand SHH chops to Alberto Del Rio in the corner as we return from commercial break. Jack Swagger's presence was enough to throw ADR off of his game. Alberto is working over Big Show's left arm. Show decides that he's going to target ADR's left arm as well. He locks in an arm bar of his own as the crowd rallies Alberto to his feet with a Si chant! HURRICANRANA BY ALBERTO! Show kicks out at two! Alberto doesn't let up and delivers a stomping. He catches Big Show with a HUGE kick to the face for two. He locks Big Show in the cross arm breaker but Big Show lifts ADR up and drops him over the top rope! Sick. Big Show breaks the count by interrupting the ref and Swagger attacks ADR on the outside! The ref ends up seeing and calls for the bell. Weak finish. Other than that though, these two have great chemistry. I'm sure that with another five minutes they could have really delivered a great match. We must make time for The Usos though.</p><p>OFFICIAL RESULT: Big Show @ 8:30 via count out</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/276819">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/276819</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
