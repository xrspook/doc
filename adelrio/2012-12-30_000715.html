I got my 13 year old daughter tickets, and judging by the kids in the crowd, so did a lot of other parents! It seemed sold out, although they didn’t use the upper deck for seats.</p><p>Matt Striker was the ring announcer/MC, and he kept the action rolling by announcing the card and other surprises during the night. Between matches, he shook hands and took pictures. Very nice guy!</p><p>The opening match was a small over-the-top battle royal with a chance to go after the Intercontinental Title later in the show. When I saw Alberto Del Rio come out, I knew he would be the winner. <strong>He actually got a good pop from the Minnesota crowd!</strong></p><p>The next match was the Triple Threat match with Alberto Del Rio vs. Wade Barrett vs. Kofi Kingston. Kingston came out to a big pop, mostly from the kids! To keep you from undue stress, Kofi won. <strong>A good solid match, with the crowd counting in Spanish whenever Alberto went for a cover.</strong> I watched Ricardo Rodriguez during the match, and the man was always moving, reacting to del Rio and whatever or wherever he was in the ring. Reminded me of Bobby the Brain Heenan in the old AWA manager days!</p><p>A good, fun night. Even my daughter had to admit that she enjoyed a live event more than the TV shows! And lots of John Cana stuff to be seen. Although I may have been the only guy there with a “I’m a Paul Heyman” t-shirt! I posted pictures in a Facebook Album at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151296577024731.486359.689489730&type=1.">http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151296577024731.486359.689489730&type=1.</a></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74303">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74303</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From Minneapolis (12/28) - Fandango In Action, Steel Cage Match, More</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri December 29, 2012</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com readers Justin Norcross, Ryan and @TubbyEmu for sending in these results from last night's SmackDown live event from the Target Center in Minneapolis, MN:</p><p>Matt Striker comes out to a decent pop. He is the ring announcer for the night and runs down the event card to pump up the fans. In his details he mentions a battle royal will open the show with the winner getting a shot at the Intercontinental Championship match later in the event. He mentioned the divas would be in action, a few tag team matches, a special match and the steel cage main event.</p><p>The first match was the Battle Royal. Participants werePrimo, Epico, Michael McGillicutty, 3MB, Justin Gabriel, Alex Riley and Alberto Del Rio. Del Rio won to earn an IC title shot later tonight.</p><p>WWE Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston defended his title by defeating Alberto Del Rio and Wade Barrett in a triple threat match. Kofi hit Barrett with Trouble In Paradise to pick up the win.</p><p>Biggest pops: <strong>Alberto Del Rio</strong> Kofi Kingston Sheamus</p><p>Most Heat: 3MB Fandango Wade Barrett</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1229/559091/wwe-live-event-results-minneapolis/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1229/559091/wwe-live-event-results-minneapolis/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Second Set of WWE Smackdown House Show Results 12.28.12</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeffrey Harris on 12.29.2012</p><p>WWE Smackdown live event Minneapolis, Minnesota at Target Center Report by Jason Powell</p><p>Matt Striker was the host of the show. He was likable and energetic throughout the night and had some impromptu fun with various performers, most notably Ricardo Rodriguez.</p><p>1) Alberto Del Rio won a 12-man battle royal to earn an Intercontinental Title shot. The final five were Del Rio, Justin Gabriel, Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre, and Jinder Mahal. <strong>Ricardo interfered on behalf of Del Rio repeatedly, including down the stretch, yet he and Del Rio played to the crowd throughout the night and were total babyfaces.</strong></p><p>5) Kofi Kingston defeated Wade Barrett and Alberto Del Rio (w/Ricardo Rodriguez) in a Triple Threat to retain the Intercontinental Title. Barrett cut a promo that appeared on the set screens at one point to set up his appearance in the match. I'm not quite sure why Del Rio had to win a battle royal to earn this match and Barrett got in, but no one seemed to mind. <strong>Del Rio continued to work as a babyface during this match.</strong> Kingston was one of the most over wrestlers of the night. The kids really dig his act. I couldn't help but wonder how over the guy could be if WWE gave his character some depth. A good Triple Threat match with some good near falls down the stretch.</p><p>Notes: The lower bowl of the arena was close to being sold out. They did not sell tickets for the upper deck. Even so, a strong showing. There appeared to be more fans in attendance for this event than there were the last time WWE taped Smackdown in the same venue. I wasn't all that excited about the show going in simply because it lacked star power compared to the loaded Raw live events this weekend. Fortunately, it exceeded my expectations and the masses seemed to leave the show feeling satisfied. An entertaining evening despite the lack of star power.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/268071">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/268071</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
