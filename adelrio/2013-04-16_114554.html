                            <h1>WWE Raw 2013-04-15 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-04-16 11:45:54+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, raw, dolph_ziggler, whc, jack_swagger, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>COMPLETE WWE RAW REPORT: MATCHES ANNOUNCED FOR EXTREME RULES; BOOKER ALMOST UTTERS THOSE THREE WORDS; THE RYBACK TALKS; I SENSE A THEME WITH THESE NON-TITLE MATCHES; CM PUNK SPEAKS; BIG SIX MAN TAG MATCH NEXT WEEK ON RAW; DID FANDANGOING DANCE OVER THE SHARK?</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-04-15 23:00:29</p><p>Last week on Raw, Mark Henry had his chance to face John Cena for the WWE Title, but he failed by count out. Mark Henry got some revenge but so did Ryback. Ryback sent John Cena a message, but what will happen when he talks about his actions? What will CM Punk say when he is given the chance to explain his loss to the Undertaker?</p><p>We are in Greenville, South Carolina and your announcers are Michael ‘Something seems familiar but I can’t put my finger on it’ Cole, John ‘Hope you sold your gold before today’ Layfield and Jerry ‘Why Isn’t Mike Rotunda here tonight’ Lawler.</p><p>We are back and John, Jerry, and Michael talk about cashing in the Money in the Bank briefcase. We take a look back at last week’s Raw when the tradition that was stopped by John Cena resumed.</p><p>Dolph Ziggler, AJ Lee, and Big E Langston walk in the back as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and the new World Champion makes his way to the ring and he is accompanied to the ring by Big E Langston and AJ Lee.</p><p>Dolph thanks AJ and he says that he successfully cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and he became the new World Champion. It was the single greatest moment in the history of Monday Night Raw. It was all because of him. Because of him. Some might say, how could you possibly top that?</p><p>He says it is easy. There has never been a World Champion as charismatic or flamboyant as him. It is time to face facts that he is just too good. Some may boo but he does not care. He doesn’t care.</p><p>Dolph says that when you are watching an NFL game and someone scores a touchdown, they are showing off. That is what you do when you are better than everyone else. He backs it up every single night. When you are as good as him, perks come with the job. Fame and fortune follows, and so does this . . . he kisses AJ.</p><p>Dolph says that no one will ever be as good as him.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring with Ricardo Rodriguez who is on crutches.</p><p>Alberto says last week he congratulated Dolph and said that when the moment was right, he is going to invoke his rematch clause. He wants his rematch in Greenville and he wants it right now.</p><p>Dolph says that he is proud that Alberto hobbled his way to the ring . . .</p><p>Dolph is interrupted by Vickie Guerrero and her excuse mes. She says that Alberto gets his rematch and the match happens now.</p><p><strong>Match Number Three: Alberto Del Rio versus Dolph Ziggler for the World Title</strong></p><p>Before the match can start, Zeb Colter and Jack Swagger come out. Zeb says that there would not be a Money in the Bank cash in or a Dolph Ziggler World Champion without Jack Swagger. He is a real champion and a real American. Dolph won only because of what Jack did. He says that Dolph doesn’t deserve to be champion and Albert does not deserve another shot.</p><p>Del Rio attacks Swagger and Jack is sent to the floor. While Del Rio stares down Langston, Swagger takes Del Rio down and he sends Del Rio’s leg into the ring post. Swagger attacks Del Rio and he applies the ankle lock.</p><p>Daniel Bryan and Kane walk to the ring as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and we take a look back at what happened when Alberto Del Rio was given a rematch, but it never happened due to Jack Swagger.</p><p>We see the medical staff checking on Del Rio’s knee.</p><p>We go to commercial while Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter make their way to the ring.</p><p>We are back with a look at what happened earlier tonight with Alberto Del Rio.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: Dolph Ziggler (with AJ Lee and Big E Langston) versus Jack Swagger (with Zeb Colter) in a Non Title Match</strong></p><p>Ziggler avoids Swagger and Ziggler shows off. Swagger puts Ziggler in the corner and he slaps him in the head. Ziggler has something to say to Swagger and he slaps him. Ziggler goes to the floor and Swagger follows after him and Ziggler ambushes Swagger as he returns to the ring. Swagger with a boot to the head.</p><p>Swagger with knees in the corner followed by a short arm clothesline. Swagger with a boot to the chest. Swagger with an Irish whip but he runs into an uppercut and Ziggler with a neck breaker. Ziggler has a drop kick blocked and Swagger tries for an ankle lock but Ziggler gets to the ropes. Ziggler drops Swagger on the top rope but Swagger puts Ziggler on the top rope in a very uncomfortable place. Swagger knocks Ziggler off the apron and to the floor as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Swagger misses a charge into the corner because he was We The Peopling and he goes shoulder first into the post. Ziggler with an inside cradle for a near fall. Swagger with a belly-to-belly suplex for a near fall. Swagger with a knee to Ziggler’s midsection. Swagger tries for the double jump Swagger Bomb and Ziggler gets his boots up.</p><p>Ziggler with a kick to the knee followed by a drop kick. Ziggler hits the leaping DDT and he gets a near fall. Swagger catches Ziggler on a Fameasser attempt and Swagger with a rollup for the three count.</p><p>Winner: Jack Swagger</p><p>After the match, while Swagger We The Peoples again, Alberto Del Rio attacks Swagger from behind and he kicks Swagger off the stage. Del Rio applies the cross arm breaker.</p><p>Del Rio points at Ziggler.</p><p>We are back and Booker T is yelling at Teddy for overstepping his bounds. Teddy says that he knows what Booker is thinking and Booker says that he doesn’t. Booker tells Teddy that Alberto might be injured and can’t compete. It means he can’t compete tonight. Swagger will get his title match. Del Rio will get his title match. Dolph Ziggler will defend the title in a Triple Threat match. He tells Teddy to do his business.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=76951">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=76951</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
