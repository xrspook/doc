                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2013-02-08 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-02-09 11:24:14+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, smackdown, big_show, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: SUSPENDED WRESTLER GETS MORE AIR TIME THAN MANY; WHO WANTS TO IMPRESS BOOKER?; MARK HENRY IMPRESSES PEOPLE; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-02-08 21:59:04</p><p>As we move closer to the Elimination Chamber pay per view, the Smackdown brand is getting closer to knowing who will have a chance at the World Champion at Wrestlemania. Will we see the Shield on tonight’s show? What will happen now that Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez are suspended for the week? Will Kane or Daniel Bryan finally snap and turn on the other, making their improbable reign as Tag Team Champions come to an end sooner rather than later (or will it drag out another few months).</p><p>We are in Jacksonville, Florida and your announcers are Josh ‘Why are people chanting Tebow in the building’ Mathews and John ‘LOUD NOISES’ Layfield.</p><p>A motor coach pulls up to the building and a man emerges to tell Big Show that the coast is clear. Show asks the driver if there was a pothole in Jacksonville that he missed. Show walks quickly into the building and he makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Show says that things are unacceptable. He is tired of the way that he has been treated. He is sick and tired of the double standards around here. Show says that he realizes that nobody likes him, but is it a crime to not be popular? Is it okay to be forced into unjustly putting his World Title on the line last month in a Last Man Standing Match that he had no time to prepare for?</p><p>Is it okay that a Latin maniac like Alberto Del Rio can ambush him in his hotel room because he is unpopular? The people are cheering their champion for acting like a criminal. That is why Alberto wants to be on your good side because you can do whatever you want when you are popular.</p><p>Show says that when he fights like a man and decimates Alberto and Ricardo, he is called a bully and a bad person. Show says that he tries to act like a business man and people tell him that he sucks and they call him a coward because he does not want to get physically with Alberto. Then they cheer Alberto for attacking him.</p><p>Show says that he signed the contract before the Mexican Clint Eastwood attacked him. The World Title is coming back where it belongs.</p><p>The double standards. . . big deal. Alberto gets suspended for what he did and he gets a night off. There is one person responsible for the double standards and the way that he has been treated. Booker T is jealous of what Show has accomplished in the ring, his wealth, and he is jealous because Show is still a dominant in ring competitive force while Booker is a sad man sitting behind a desk pushing a pencil.</p><p>Booker T’s music plays and he makes his way to the stage.</p><p>Booker wants to know what Show’s problem is. He tells Show that he got everything that he asked for. Show had a rematch for the World Title at the Royal Rumble and Show blew it. Booker says that Alberto and him do not like bullies and Show continues to bully Ricardo Rodriguez. Booker tells Show that won’t get him anywhere.</p><p>Show tells Booker that he wants to know who gave Alberto his hotel information.</p><p>Booker wants to know why he would do that.</p><p>Show says that the way Booker stays relevant is by taking down one of the greatest superstars in Smackdown history.</p><p>Booker says he treats everyone on Smackdown equal. That is why Alberto is not here tonight. He suspended him.</p><p>Show says that Booker has not answered his question about the hotel information.</p><p>Booker dodges the question by saying that Show is 7 feet tall and 550 pounds. Anyone could have given Alberto the information. He tells Show to be concerned about his opponent tonight.</p><p>Show asks Booker if he is dressed for a match. Show tells Booker to let him know about his match. He calls Booker incompetent.</p><p>Booker says that Show knows his opponent because he has had many battles with him over the last year. There is good news and bad news. Show’s opponent lost his match on Raw. The bad news is that he is in a very bad move. Show’s opponent will have to impress Booker tonight to get into the Elimination Chamber. Booker tells Show that he will be facing Kane.</p><p>Show says that is not fair because he does not have time to prepare.</p><p>We go to the back and Big Show yells at his driver for not setting the proper temperature. Show also complains about his food. Show says that he can find any moron to do his job. Show sends him back inside the bus and he tells him to unclog the toilet. Show goes into the building for his match and we see Alberto Del Rio in the parking lot.</p><p><strong>Match Number Three Big Show versus Kane in a Someone has to try to impress Booker T Match</strong></p><p>Kane punches Show but Show with an Irish whip and butt splash into the corner. Kane goes for the knees and then he drop kicks Show through the ropes and to the floor. Kane with a kick to Show from the apron but Show sends Kane into the ring steps. Show rolls Kane into the ring and then he sends Kane’s leg into the ring post.</p><p>We see Booker and Teddy watching the match. Show with an elbow drop to the leg and then he works on the knee and ankle. Show with a heel hook but Kane kicks Show away. Show with a spear and we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Show with a Vader Bomb for a near fall. Show goes up again but he misses the Vader Bomb when Kane moves out of the way. Kane with punches but Show punches back and the booing and yaying continues. Show grabs Kane by the throat but Kane does the same to Show. Show with a kick to the knee but Kane with a DDT and both men are down.</p><p>Kane goes up top for the clothesline and he connects but Kane appears to have hurt his knee. Show with the knock out punch for the three count.</p><p>Winner: Big Show</p><p>After the match, the suspended man is outside the building via the TitanTron. Alberto says that he found a new friend and it is Show’s bus driver. Alberto says that he was told that Show was not happy with his tour bus so he made some changes. Del Rio invites Show to come out to check on the changes.</p><p>Show goes to the back and then outside. He sees that his bus has been put on blocks. Show’s night is about to go from bad to worse because he gets orange paint poured on him from the top of the bus by Alberto Del Rio. Alberto tells Show that he has some tires if he needs them. Alberto and Ricardo drive away.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75302/wwe-smackdown-report-suspended-wrestler-gets-more-air-time-than-many-who-wants-to-impress-booker-mark-henry-impresses-people-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/75302/wwe-smackdown-report-suspended-wrestler-gets-more-air-time-than-many-who-wants-to-impress-booker-mark-henry-impresses-people-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
