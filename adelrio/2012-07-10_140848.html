AND THEN POOF . . . HE IS GONE</strong><br><br>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-07-09 23:04:23<br><br>We begin with footage from last week when CM Punk and Daniel Bryan had their match and AJ felt unloved because they actually cared about wrestling. Then AJ decided to ‘GET THE TABLES’ and she was going to throw herself through the table. Then it continued on Smackdown when Punk said that he cared about AJ. Daniel Bryan tried to clear the air and he got kissed. Then Punk got kissed. Who will AJ skip past and kiss tonight?<br><br>We are live from Denver, Colorado and your announcers are Michael ‘Avalanche’ Cole and Jerry ‘When do I get to beat Heath Slater’ Lawler. <br><br>We are back with the Slam of the Week: Alberto Del Rio trying to fix the immigration problem only to see Sheamus show his support for the immigrants. Then Del Rio attacked the man he will face on Sunday night.<br><br>Match Number One: Sheamus versus Jack Swagger<br><br>Swagger with a waist lock and take down. Sheamus with elbows to Swagger and Swagger sends Sheamus to the turnbuckles. Swagger tries for the double jump Swagger Bomb but Sheamus gets up and hits White Noise. Sheamus channels his inner Orton and looks around before hitting the Brogue Kick for the three count.<br><br>Winner: Sheamus<br><br>A car drives in the back and Del Rio says that Swagger is no Del Rio. He did what no one else has done on Smackdown. He left him like a dying burro. Del Rio says that he will take the title from Sheamus on Sunday.<br><br>While Del Rio drives away, Sheamus drills Swagger with another Brogue Kick. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=70042">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=70042</a> </p><blockquote><p><strong>411's WWE RAW Report 7.9.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Tony Acero on 07.09.2012 <br><br>After the match, we see Alberto Del Rio honking his horn on the screen. He claims that Sheamus did great, but he is not Swagger. No one is Del Rio. He says he is going to take the World Heavyweight Championship this Sunday. Del Rio hops in his car and drives away. Then it blows up! I'm kidding. Sheamus turns around to Brogue Kick Jack Swagger one more time. Oh come on, was that necessary?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/245776">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/245776</a><br></p>
