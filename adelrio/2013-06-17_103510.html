The crowd chanted for RVD. Del Rio was able to drill Ziggler with several shots to the head and Ziggler acted like he was dazed, which the announcers pushed. Del Rio nailed a big back suplex.</p><p>Ziggler ended up on the floor. Big E. Langston shoved Del Rio and was thrown out by the referee. Ziggler came alive with offense, slamming Del Rio's head into the table. Del Rio came back to stomp the hell out of Ziggler and nail him with a series of headbutts.</p><p>Del Rio continued the assault but Ziggler grabbed a sleeper. Del Rio escaped and drilled Ziggler with a bunch of shots to the back and head. He nailed a backstabber for a two count. Del Rio went for the rolling armbreaker but Ziggler countered it. The fans chanted, "Let's go Ziggler."</p><p>Ziggler went to the top but was caught by Del Rio and nailed with a superplex that saw Ziggler sent into the ring face-first. Del Rio continued working over Ziggler, who kept kicking out. Ziggler surviving the onslaught really got the Chicago fans behind him. Ziggler nailed the Zig Zag out of nowhere but landed on his head, so he was unable to capitalize.</p><p>Del Rio nailed him with a superkick and pinned him.</p><p>Your winner and new World champion, Alberto Del Rio!</p><p>A really good match with Ziggler really bumping his rear end off. The story was that Del Rio kept laying out Ziggler with shots to the head and Ziggler kept trying to rebound, but in the end, it was too much. The way it was portrayed, you would think Ziggler would be a babyface going forward. This felt like a double turn, so don't expect a Punk turn tonight. It's a real shame Ziggler come back from his concussion only to be booked to lose the belt. That was a bummer but I guess now we know why Dolph was knocking the company on Twitter.</p><p>Ziggler dropped down in the aisle as he left. The crowd chanted his name.</p><p>World champion Alberto Del Rio came back after a promotional commercial aired. He cut a promo thanking the Chicago fans. He said he proved to Chicago and the entire world why he deserved to be the champion. He said he's done everything since he's come to WWE and he did it just for you, the fans, every night. Del Rio said that tonight, he asked Chicago and the world for their support. He said that they know he's one of the best in the business and gives of his life and gives 100%. He said that after tonight, he felt he deserved to be champion and asked the fans to cheer for their new champion. Ricardo officially announced him.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=78299&p=2">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=78299&p=2</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
