I arrived at the arena several hours early in hopes of meeting a few of the wrestlers. The first I saw arrive was Ryback. He basically nodded to the crowd and walked in. Next up was Kaitlyn and A.J. They didn't acknowledge us and walked straight in as well. I was just about to walk in when Damien Sandow and Tyson Kidd pulled up. Sandow walked in, but Kidd walked up and was very fan-friendly. He signed autographs and took pictures with anyone who wanted one. Very Cool. Now onto the show. Matt Striker came out and served as ring announcer for the evening.<br><br>(8) World Hvt. champion Sheamus defeated Alberto Del Rio (w/Ricardo Rodriguez) to retain the World Heavyweight Title. Great match, and Rodriguez did a great job interacting with the crowd. Sheamus landed the Brogue kick for the win. After the match, Sheamus posed and shook hands with the crowd.<br><br>Overall, it was a really good show. The arena was not quite half-full, which was disappointing, but they were very vocal, and into every match. The set-up was also much more elaborate than any other house show I have been to, including two big screens to play videos before the show, play entrances, and even included a backstage promo from Del Rio and Rodriguez.<br><br>Biggest Pops:<br><br>(1) Sheamus<br>(2) Christian<br>(3) Kane/Sin Cara<br><br>Biggest Heat:<br><br>(1) Alberto Del Rio<br>(2) Cody Rhodes<br>(3) Damien Sandow</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/240857">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/240857</a> <br></p>
