TRUTH, PUNK AND REY STEAL THE SHOW AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Mike Johnson on 2011-06-19 22:54:00</p><p>Welcome to PWInsider.com's live, ongoing WWE Capitol Punishment PPV from Washington, D.C. Coverage will begin at 8 PM Eastern!</p><p>Sgt. Slaughter welcomed a Barack Obama impersonator. Obama said that Del Rio and Show would both be covered under Obama care. Vickie Guerrero showed up and sang “Happy Father’s Day” to him but the Secret Service carried her off. Slaughter said that “it looked like Vickie got carried away.” AWFUL!</p><p>They pushed that you’ll be able to vote with your mobile phone tomorrow on the three hour Raw.</p><p><strong>Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>Show attacked Del Rio in the aisle as he came to the ring. Del Rio tried to escape over the railing into the crowd but Show stopped him, chopped him and whipped Del Rio hard into the barrier.</p><p>Show rolled Del Rio back into the ring, only to be attacked by Mark Henry. Henry tossed him over the announce table. He drilled Show through the Spanish Announce Table with the World’s Strongest Slam.</p><p>Henry walked off but changed his mind, returning. He grabbed the leg that Del Rio’s car ran over and slammed it into the remnants of the table. In the ring, Del Rio was taunting Show. He demanded that the referee count Show out. The ref began the count but Show rolled into the ring.</p><p>Show told the referee he was willing to go so they rang the bell. Show nailed Del Rio and caught him for a chokeslam but Del Rio kicked Show’s bad leg. The leg went out and Del Rio began kicking the hell out of the Show, trying to keep him on the mat. He covered Show but only got a one count.</p><p>Show grabbed Del Rio and chokeslammed him. Show’s leg crumpled and he went to the mat. Del Rio rolled outside to the floor. Show limped over to the ropes and grabbed Del Rio. Rio snapped him over the ropes. He went to the corner but was caught by the throat. Alberto nailed his leg again. Del Rio went for the rolling crossarm breaker but Show turned it into a throw, sending Alberto to the mat.</p><p>Del Rio begged off but dropkicked Show’s leg. He locked on a cross legbreaker on the bad leg. Show fought it and finally grabbed the ropes. Del Rio began stalking Show from behind, waiting to strike. The referee warned Show that he would stop the match if Show couldn’t continue. Show got up but collapsed down again. The referee called it.</p><p>Your winner, Alberto Del Rio!</p><p>More of an angle than a match but it was a good angle. It put Mark Henry back in the mix as a monster. It gave more momentum to Del Rio and put Show, who showed some nice fire as a pissed off monster, a reason for revenge.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/59089/complete-wwe-capitol-punishment-ppv-coverage-two-title-changes-cena-vs-truth-punk-and-rey-steal-the-show-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/59089/complete-wwe-capitol-punishment-ppv-coverage-two-title-changes-cena-vs-truth-punk-and-rey-steal-the-show-and-more.html?p=1</a></p>
