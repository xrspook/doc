It is safe to say that Dolph is no longer the #HEEL and tossed his shirt into the crowd plus shook hands with fans. Majority of the crowd was behind Alberto but he was able to get the fans to boo him after he won his match. Wanted to give Dolph a present by hitting him with a chair but Dolph ducked and nailed the Zig Zag to close the show and ran around the ring to shake hands with the fans!</p><p>I give this show 4 out of 5 stars.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=78731">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=78731</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From Wildwood, NJ (7/5): Dolph Ziggler Gets Title Shot, Hall Of Famer Appears</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | July 06, 2013</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Nicholas Cannella for sending in these results from last night's WWE live event in Wildwood, NJ:</p><p>Alberto Del Rio cut a promo on the video screen telling everyone that he is a true World Champion and he will defend his title against Dolph Ziggler but he said about Ziggler "I don't like the way you look, the way you talk, the way you walk and the way you smell and tonight I will destroy you in a Last Man Standing Match and still be the World Champion!"</p><p>(7) World Hvt. Champion Alberto Del Rio defeated Dolph Ziggler in a Last Man Standing Match to retain the World Title when Del Rio kicked Ziggler in the head and couldn't ansewer the 10 count. Afterwards Del Rio said "I'm everyones true World Champion and now all the people here in Wildwood can go out and eat Hot Dogs, burgers and french fries to keep getting fatter and fatter, so now I have big suprise for everyone and thats Ziggler's brain all over this place." He then grabbed a chair swingged and missed but Ziggler hit him with the Zig Zag to send the crowd home happy and greeted the fans as well. During the Match both used Kendo sticks, a chair and ADR put Ziggler through a table.</p><p>The Oceanfront Convention Center was about half full with a decent amount of seats still available. But overall, a solid show and can't wait until WWE returns to Wildwood next summer!</p><p>Biggest Pops: Orton Ziggler Tons of Funk Usos</p><p>Biggest Heat: Sandow and Cody Big E. and AJ Del Rio</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0706/563910/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0706/563910/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
