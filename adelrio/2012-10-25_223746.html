                            <h1>WWE Raw 2011-05-09 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2012-10-25 22:37:46+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2011, 战报, raw, rey_mysterio, the_miz</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE RAW REPORT: MATCHES ANNOUNCED FOR OVER THE LIMIT; KHARMA MAKES A STRONG FOURTH IMPRESSION; COLE SHOULD HAVE CLOSED UP THE AIR HOLES IN HIS SKINNER BOX</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-05-09 23:04:19</p><p>We are live from Knoxville, Tennessee and your announcers are Michael ‘The Lane Kiffin of WWE’ Cole, Josh ‘The Bruce Pearl of the WWE’ Mathews and Jerry ‘The Pat Summit of the WWE’ Lawler.</p><p>The show starts with Alberto Del Rio making his way to the ring as Ricardo Rodriguez introduces him.</p><p>Del Rio introduces himself but we know who he is already. Alberto says that it is his destiny to be the World Champion but it was stolen by the retired Edge. He says that destiny can be delayed, but it cannot be stopped. Alberto wonders why we wasted so much time last week with the Rock. It should have been a celebration of the arrival of Alberto Del Rio. The WWE Champion is John Cena, but we know that there is no one better than him. Alberto says that he should be the number one contender.</p><p>Rey Mysterio’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring. Rey tells Alberto that he is no more worthy to have a title match than him. They both got drafted to Raw and he is going to tell Alberto what he has said before. It isn’t Alberto’s destiny to be champion, it is his destiny to be the personal ring announcer of Ricardo Rodriguez. In order to determine the number one contender, he is challenging Alberto to a match tonight.</p><p>Alberto tells Rey to listen to him like the little Chihuahua that he is. If he has to beat Rey for the thousandth time . . .</p><p>We hear Awesome first and Miz comes to the ring followed his personal young boy, Alex Riley.</p><p>Miz throws out a few reallys. He says that Teddy Long’s incompetence on Smackdown led to things, but draft or no draft, this is still his show. The WWE Championship is still his title. If not for the incompetence of his assistant last week, he would still be WWE Champion.</p><p>Alberto says that Miz had his chance and he didn’t get the job done. He tells Miz that he goes to the back of the line.</p><p>Miz says that he got the job done and he pinned John Cena. Last week, he was announced the WWE Champion. Then the prejudiced referee reversed the decision. Miz says that he didn’t know what Alex Riley was going to do. Miz says that he used the belt before Cena could. Miz demands a legitimate rematch and then he tells Alberto and Rey that they can fight in a Taco Bell parking lot. Miz says that he is the only person who should be facing John Cena.</p><p>R Truth comes out to the ring without wanting to know ‘What’s Up’. Truth says that we can’t get along and since everyone is spitting a bit of hate, he wants to spit a little hate of his own. Truth says that he hates hospital food. He says that it is as dry as a desert, it smells bad, and it tastes bad. He says you never get it when you really want. Truth says that John Morrison is eating a lot of hospital food now because of what happened last week. We go to the video tape.</p><p>Truth is proud of what he did and says that Morrison had to have surgery and he says that it is on WWE.com if you don’t believe him. Truth sends a shout out to John Morrison. P.S. hospital food gives you constipation.</p><p>Truth says that he has no problem making sure that everyone in the ring is hooked up to the same IV. He says that they can share the same bedpan too. It doesn’t matter if you’re some pretty boy from L.A. and he calls Miz ‘Kermit’. It doesn’t matter if you are some super hero wannabe from San Diego and he calls Rey ‘bottle nose’. It doesn’t matter if you’re some pompous Mexican fence jumper and he calls Del Rio ‘liver lips’.</p><p>When an angry black man is talking, everyone needs to shut it up. Truth says that he is not going to wait around like he did over the last ten years. The only person who is going to face John Cena is him and that is the TRUTH.</p><p>We get an Instantly Annoying Message and Michael Cole gets to grace us with his reading comprehension skills. Cole quotes and says that despite all of the compelling arguments, only three deserve it. There will be a Triple Threat match to see who faces John Cena at Over The Limit.</p><p>Miz is right that he deserves a rematch so he is in. Alberto Del Rio is the crown jewel of the WWE Draft so he is in too. As for the third competitor . . .</p><p>By virtue of his victory last week, the third competitor is Rey Mysterio.</p><p>Truth is not happy with the announcement and he wants to know why it happened to him again. Truth says that he is better than everyone, especially Rey.</p><p>Rey tells Truth that for once, he is agreeing with the General Manager. Truth should not be in the match and that’s What’s Up and that’s the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</p><p>Truth leaves the ring, but is this the last time we see Truth tonight?</p><p>Miz tells Alberto and Rey that it doesn’t matter what they accomplished or did not accomplish on Smackdown. They need to learn that on Raw, they are day laborers, chump change, and bench warmers because the star of this show and the next WWE Champion is . . .</p><p>Ricardo jumps in and says ‘Alberto Del Rio’ and Alberto laughs. Alex Riley attacks Del Rio but Rodriguez takes care of Riley. Miz goes after Rodriguez and then Del Rio and Miz battle to the floor. Rey with a plancha onto Del Rio to the floor.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: Alberto Del Rio versus Miz versus Rey Mysterio in a Number One Contender Match</strong></p><p>Miz goes after Rey but Rey moves.
