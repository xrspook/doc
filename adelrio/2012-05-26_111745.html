Meanwhile, Daniel Bryan delivered an earth-shattering onslaught to The Big Red Monster Kane.<br><br>John Laurinaitis' Executive Administrator Eve opened SmackDown, reiterating the point that – after "cementing his physical superiority" by pinning John Cena at WWE Over the Limit – “Mr. Excitement” is still the General Manager of Raw and SmackDown. Revealing that an international WWE business trip would keep the Executive Vice President of Talent Relations from being on SmackDown, she reassured one and all that she had been left in charge of the action.<br><br>While informing the WWE Universe that “Big Johnny” would deal will Cena on Monday night’s Raw SuperShow, the Diva-in-charge announced that World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus would be giving a public apology later in the show for shoving his injured boss four days eariler. <br><br>However, before Eve could continue, Del Rio, Randy Orton and Kane all interrupted, each giving a very compelling argument as to why they should be the next Superstar to face The Great White for his illustrious championship gold. In response, the Executive Administrator announced a Triple Threat World Title main event between them to determine Sheamus' new No. 1 contender.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-25/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-25/results</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Del Rio snatched Triple Threat triumph to earn a chance at the 'World'</strong><br><br>BY Michael Burdick May 25, 2012<br><br><strong>United States Champion Santino Marella def. Ricardo Rodriguez</strong><br><br>Four days after engaging in a debate over "the art of introductioning" on Monday’s Raw Supershow, Santino Marella squared off with a tuxedo-wearing Ricardo Rodriguez in a hilarious one-on-one match-up.<br><br>Toying with Alberto Del Rio’s personal ring announcer from the opening bell, the United States Champion made the WWE Universe fall out of their seats with laughter from start to finish. Then, moments after Santino's dizziness from his own airplane spin caused him to fall through the ropes, The Italian Stallion disappeared under the ring. As Ricardo waited for him to come out the other side, the titleholder re-emerged behind him and put him out of his misery with the Cobra.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-25/results/page-5">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-25/results/page-5</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Del Rio snatched Triple Threat triumph to earn a chance at the 'World'</strong><br><br>BY Michael Burdick May 25, 2012<br><br><strong>Alberto Del Rio won the Triple Threat World Title No. 1 Contender’s Match<br></strong><br>As Kane entered the ring to compete against Alberto Del Rio and Randy Orton in the Triple Threat World Title No.1 Contender’s Match, Daniel Bryan suddenly emerged from nowhere, unleashing an absolutely rabid assault on The Big Red Monster. After blasting him with a steel chair 26 times, WWE’s "Yes!" man left the monstrous target of his rage lying in the canvas in incredible pain. <br><br>In spite of the incredible onslaught he suffered just moments earlier, The Devil’s Favorite Demon would choose to still compete against two of Friday night’s best for the right to face World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus at No Way Out.<br><br>In the height of the action, Bryan returned with the steel chair. This would distract Kane long enough for Orton to regain the advantage and hit his masked opponent with the RKO. However, just when it looked like The Viper was going to grab the three-count, Del Rio took him out of the equation, stealing the huge win to become the new No. 1 contender for the World Heavyweight Title.<br><br>As the Mexican Superstar celebrated at the top of the ramp, Sheamus emerged, sending a clear message to his aristocratic new challenger that he can’t wait to kick his head off at the coming pay-per-view.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-25/results/page-9">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-05-25/results/page-9</a> <br></p>
