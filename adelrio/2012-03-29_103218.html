The decision to pull Christian was made early on Monday.<br><br>Regarding Alberto Del Rio being pulled, WWE officials looked at the 12-man match and felt that Del Rio didn't fit in it. They are planning on pushing Del Rio soon and didn't want him in a match that will be full of comedy and other shenanigans. With that said, it's interesting to note that they kept guys like Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger and The Miz in the match.<br><br>It's said that WWE has something grander planned for Del Rio this year. Instead of returning in the 12-man match, officials want Del Rio to have a more dramatic return to the company. Even though he recently participated in the angle with John Laurinaitis, the original plan was to do Del Rio vs. Randy Orton at WrestleMania and sources report that the Orton vs. Del Rio feud is still planned. The decision to pull Del Rio was made in the last week some time.<br><br>Despite being pulled from the match, expect Del Rio and Christian to appear in a backstage WrestleMania segment or Del Rio could even work the dark match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/334948622.shtml"></a><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/334948622.shtml">http://nodq.com/wwe/334948622.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>More On Christian And Alberto Del Rio Being Off Wrestlemania</strong><br><br>Posted by Joseph Lee on 03.28.2012<br><br>They may still be on camera...<br><br>As previously reported, Christian was pulled from the Team Teddy vs Team Johnny 12-man tag match at Wrestlemania 28 due to issues from his ankle injury.<br><br>Meanwhile, Alberto Del Rio was scheduled to be a part of the match, but WWE officials felt it was "beneath him" and are planning something more dramatic for his return. They don't feel a tag team match is good enough for the former WWE Champion, who is expected to get a big push this year. A feud with Randy Orton is being discussed at this time.<br><br>Both Christian and Del Rio are expected to be in attendance for the show and may even appear on camera at some point.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/231393"></a><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/231393">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/231393</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>¿Por qué Alberto Del Rio fue sacado de la lucha de 12 hombres en Wrestlemania 28?</strong><br><br>28 marzo 2012 por superdavid1994<br><br><strong>Los siguientes son rumores de supuestas fuentes cercanas a la WWE, no podemos confirmarlos, pero nos parecen interesantes para la comunidad.</strong><br><br>Alberto Del Rio fue sacado de la lucha de 12 hombres en Wrestlemania 28 debido a que los oficiales vieron como se estaba formando la lucha y consideraron que Alberto Del Rio no encajaba en esta lucha. Están planeando darle un “push” pronto a Alberto Del Rio y por eso no querían que estuviera en esta lucha que estara lleno de comedia y artimañas de otros.<br><br>Con lo que se acaba de decir, es interesante observar que se mantuvieran a talentos como Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger y The Miz en esta lucha. Se dice que la WWE tienen algo más grande planeado para Alberto Del Rio este año. En lugar de colocarlo en la lucha de 12 hombres, los oficiales quieren que Alberto del Rio tenga su regreso a la compañía más espectacular.<br><br>A pesar de que recientemente él participo en un ángulo con John Laurinaitis, el plan original era que Alberto Del Rio enfrentara a Randy Orton en Wrestlemania 28, supuestas fuentes de la WWE informan que esta rivalidad entre Randy Orton y Alberto Del Rio todavía se prevé que se realice. La decisión de retirar a Alberto Del Rio de la lucha de 12 hombres se tomo en algún momento de la semana pasada.<br><br>A pesar de que fuera sacado de la lucha de 12 hombres, se espera que Alberto Del Rio realice un segmento en Backstage en Wrestlemania 28 o incluso cabe la posibilidad de que participe en el dark match de la noche.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://superluchas.net/2012/03/28/por-que-alberto-del-rio-fue-sacado-de-la-lucha-de-12-hombres-en-wrestlemania-28/"></a><a href="http://superluchas.net/2012/03/28/por-que-alberto-del-rio-fue-sacado-de-la-lucha-de-12-hombres-en-wrestlemania-28/">http://superluchas.net/2012/03/28/por-que-alberto-del-rio-fue-sacado-de-la-lucha-de-12-hombres-en-wrestlemania-28/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE News: The Latest on the Plans for Alberto Del Rio When He Returns to the WWE</strong><br><br>By Chris Humphrey (Featured Columnist) on March 28, 2012<br><br><br>Besides his brief appearance at Elimination Chamber this past February, when he put his faith in Raw GM John Laurinaitis, we have not seen former WWE champion Alberto Del Rio on television since the beginning of 2012.<br><br>With his return to the WWE pegged for after WrestleMania this Sunday, what's in the works for Del Rio after he recovers from a groin injury suffered earlier in the year?<br><br>From Wrestling News Source:<br><br> Also, before Del Rio's injury, there was talk of Del Rio vs. Randy Orton at this year's WrestleMania, and WWE is still thinking about doing the Del Rio/Orton feud, which would seem to indicate that either Orton will get traded back to Raw or Del Rio will get traded back to SmackDown.<br><br> It's been previously reported over the past few months that WWE plans on giving Alberto Del Rio a mega push when he returns. He's been told to be much more vicious and aggressive inside the ring as well. There have also allegedly been talks of giving him another World Title run on Raw or SmackDown at some point down the line.<br><br>First, I would have loved to see Del Rio take on Orton at WrestleMania this weekend. That is, instead of the Viper taking on Kane in a match that was tossed together when the two superstars were left without a feud after Elimination Chamber.<br><br>In addition to his possible feud with Orton this spring, I think it would be a wise decision by the WWE if they sent Del Rio back to Smackdown to help give the blue brand some more talent.<br><br>However, a potential run at the world heavyweight champion on Smackdown is a slightly different situation.<br><br>Giving the belt to Del Rio would be good idea, but only if the WWE were to give him a long run like Daniel Bryan instead of those two short WWE championship runs last fall.<br><br>Even though not being sold on Del Rio in the early part of his WWE career, the former champion's new, aggressive style could be a great move after he seemed a bit robotic in his first year with the company.<br><br>So, Bleachers, what do you think about the WWE giving ADR a major push when he returns to the company on a full-time basis after WrestleMania?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1122696-wwe-news-the-latest-on-the-plans-for-alberto-del-rio-when-he-returns-to-the-wwe">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1122696-wwe-news-the-latest-on-the-plans-for-alberto-del-rio-when-he-returns-to-the-wwe</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE WrestleMania 28: Major Update on Plans for Alberto Del Rio</strong>By Drake Oz (Featured Columnist) on March 28, 2012<br><br>Alberto Del Rio is not going to be competing at WrestleMania 28, and the WWE’s decision to keep him off the card has been a head-scratcher for many.<br><br>After the former WWE champion threw his support behind John Laurinaitis at last month’s Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, the widespread belief was that he would eventually be revealed as a member of Team Johnny.<br><br>Yet, Team Johnny is set, and Del Rio is not a part of it, which leaves us to wonder why he was left off the WWE’s biggest pay-per-view of the year.<br><br>Apparently, it was done for a few very specific reasons.<br><br>From PWInsider.com (via WrestleNewz.com):<br><br> Regarding Alberto Del Rio being pulled, WWE officials looked at the 12-man match and felt that Del Rio didn’t fit in it. They are planning on pushing Del Rio soon and didn’t want him in a match that will be full of comedy and other shenanigans. With that said, it’s interesting to note that they kept guys like Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger and The Miz in the match.<br><br> It’s said that WWE has something grander planned for Del Rio this year.

The decision to pull Del Rio was made in the last week some time.<br><br> Despite being pulled from the match, expect Del Rio and Christian to appear in a backstage WrestleMania segment or Del Rio could even work the dark match.<br><br>Now that I think about it, this is probably a good idea.<br><br>While I wanted to see Del Rio on Team Johnny because it made sense storyline-wise and gave the match some more star power, he really isn’t going to benefit all that much from being one of six heels who beats a baby face team comprised primarily of comedy characters.<br><br>I may not be a huge Del Rio fan, but he is one of the better overall heel performers in the WWE. If the creative team has bigger plans for him, it should hold off on bringing him back until it can set up his new storyline, which apparently will be a feud with Randy Orton.<br><br>Consider me a fan of a potential Orton/ADR feud. ADR has already feuded with CM Punk and John Cena, and besides Sheamus, Orton is really the only top face that he has yet to have a rivalry with.<br><br>The WWE can easily set up for a Del Rio vs. Orton feud after the 2012 WWE draft, which will likely take place after April’s Extreme Rules pay-per-view.<br><br>Whether it be on Raw or Smackdown, I’d make sure that these two guys are on the same brand, and that—unlike the Orton/Kane feud—their reasoning for feuding actually makes sense.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1122632-wwe-wrestlemania-28-major-update-on-plans-for-alberto-del-rio">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1122632-wwe-wrestlemania-28-major-update-on-plans-for-alberto-del-rio</a><br></p>
