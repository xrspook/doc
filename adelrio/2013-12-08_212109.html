The entire top section was blocked off all and there were a lot of empty seats in the lower bowl. Most of the people there were families who were there to see John Cena. It was my first time sitting front row, which made the show a lot more enjoyable.</p><p>Before the show started, Justin Roberts said we could decide if the Funkadactlys, Alicia Fox, and Aksana would compete in a dance-off or a tag team match.</p><p>(8) World Hvt. champion John Cena beat Alberto Del Rio via pinfall to retain the World Heavyweight Championship Cena got the biggest pop of the night by far and Del Rio might have had the most heat just because he was facing Cena. Del Rio targeted Cena's left arm for most of the match and Cena was driven into the steel steps. The referee was knocked out when Del Rio tapped out to the STF and Cena thought he won. Del Rio then hit Cena with the title and pinned Cena who had his eyes open looking at the ref the entire time which took the drama out of the nearfall completely. Cena eventually gave Del Rio the AA for the victory.</p><p>After the match, Cena walked around only part of the ringside area, which disappointed a lot of people, even me.</p><p>Overall, it was not the best house show that I have been to, but there was some good wrestling on the show. I was expecting C.M. Punk when I got the tickets, but Punk was pulled off the line-up a month ago. WWE didn't announce a return date to Sacramento, but they are coming to Oakland and San Jose in February for some house shows. Finally, I'm really excited for WrestleMania coming to the Bay Area in 2015!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_74994.shtml#.UqRt6CfI1tA">http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article_74994.shtml#.UqRt6CfI1tA</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Live Event Results From Sacramento (12/7): Cena And Ambrose Defend, NXT Star In Action</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | December 08, 2013</p><p>WWE Live Event Results From Sacramento (12/7): Cena And Ambrose Defend, NXT Star In Action Photo: Nicole (@nicole<em>rose</em>54) Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Cristal for sending in these results from last night's WWE live event in Sacramento:</p><p>Main Event: John Cena vs Alberto Del Rio for the World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rio came out to some heat, it got worse as he started taunting the crowd and ripping up some kid's poster. Cena out to a huge ovation. Good match lots of near falls and action outside of the ring. Del Rio threw Cena into the steel steps and then got on top of them and ripped cenas shirt and mocked him with you can't see me gesture. He seemed to approve of the few of us in our area that were chanting "Si Si Si" he looked over and gave us a smile. Cena wins, sends the kids home happy. Justin Roberts thanks us says they will be back but doesn't say when.</p><p>Apparently the event in Stockton the night before featured the same show except their main event was Sandow and Rio vs Cena in a 2 on 1 match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1208/568102/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1208/568102/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
