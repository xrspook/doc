WHAT COULD GO WRONG? . . . LET ME COUNT THE WAYS</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-03-04 21:59:48</p><p>We begin this week’s show with a look back at last week’s announcement by Teddy Long that as a result of her involvement with the attack on him, Vickie’s WWE career was on the line in a mixed tag match. Vickie lost the match, but you already knew that, and as a result, she was fired from WWE. Vickie’s attempts to beg for her job were futile because Teddy still fired her and Edge would not help her because he was more interested in getting an audition tape for the next season of American Idol.</p><p>We are live on tape from Cleveland, Ohio and your announcers are Michael ‘Yo bartender. . . Jobu needs a refill’ Cole, Josh ‘You may run like Hayes, but you hit like <strong></strong>’ Mathews, and Booker ‘Hats for Bats’ T.</p><p>We see footage from September (back in the days before SyFy) when Christian was injured by Alberto Del Rio thanks to the cross arm breaker and being sent into the ring post with a chair wrapped around the arm.</p><p>Josh mentions the return of Christian at the Elimination Chamber to go after Alberto Del Rio and ‘help’ Edge?</p><p>Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez are in the back and Rodriguez is working on his pitch while Del Rio comments on a painting that is being done of him. Alberto appears to approve as we go to commercial.</p><p>Teddy says that it is time for the Wrestlemania World Championship Official Contract Signing.</p><p>Ricardo Rodriguez introduces Alberto Del Rio who drives into the building for this ceremony.</p><p>Alberto introduces himself, but we already knew that. He wants to welcome everyone to his Wrestlemania 27 Contract Signing Ceremony. The only way to begin this ceremony is with the singing of the Mexican National Anthem. Alberto hands the mic over to Ricardo and he sings the Mexican National Anthem (or was it the Soviet National Anthem in Spanish?).</p><p>Edge interrupts the anthem and he makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Edge takes his spot at the table and he puts his belt on the table.</p><p>Teddy says that for the first time in the history of Smackdown, he asks that this be a contract signing that does not end in chaos. Teddy asks them to sit down.</p><p>They sit down and as Edge starts his comments, a ‘USA’ chant rings through the arena. Edge tells Alberto that once this contract is signed, there is no turning back, the party is over. Edge says that Alberto does not know what it is like to fight on the biggest stage in the world. Edge says that he is an eleven time World Champion.</p><p>Alberto says that he already knows that but it is part of the past. No one remembers that. The contract is not just a piece of paper. It represents the next chapter in the WWE. It is not for Edge, it is for him. It is his destiny.</p><p>Edge says that Alberto talks about destiny, but it can change in the blink of an eye. Alberto’s destiny can be that he is the fastest rising star in the history of the WWE or his destiny can be that Edge is going to beat him at Wrestlemania and he is just another flash in the pan that he made famous for just one moment.</p><p>Alberto tells the perro to listen to him. He says that Edge got one thing right. Once he signs the contract, it is the beginning of the end . . . for you.</p><p>Alberto laughs and gives the contract to Edge. Edge signs the contract and stares at Alberto.</p><p>Edge hands the contract to Teddy and then he brings up Teddy’s wish that this contract signing wouldn’t end in chaos. Edge apologizes to Teddy for continuing the streak. Edge stares at Alberto and Teddy leaves the ring. Alberto punches first but Edge leaps over the table and he punches Alberto. Edge throws the table out of the way so he can give Alberto an Impaler DDT. Edge sets up for a spear but Ricardo Rodriguez grabs Edge’s leg and Alberto takes advantage and attacks Edge. Del Rio punches Edge and then he thinks about the cross arm breaker and he puts Edge in it.</p><p>Del Rio releases the hold and then he throws Edge to the floor. Del Rio puts Edge in a hammer lock and sends him into the ringside barrier. Alberto tells Ricardo to get a chair for him. Alberto puts the arm in the chair in the same manner that he did to Christian.</p><p>Speaking of Christian, he comes to the ring and he goes after Alberto. Christian sends Alberto into the announce table and then he punches Alberto. They go into the ring and Christian punches Del Rio. Alberto goes to the floor and goes up the ramp but Christian tackles Alberto. Referees come out to try to stop Christian.</p><p>Ricardo helps Alberto up while Christian helps Edge up as we go to credits.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/55767/wwe-smackdown-report-undertaker-makes-his-return-cody-rhodes-explains-his-sinister-plan-a-contract-signing-what-could-go-wrong-let-me-count-the-ways.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/55767/wwe-smackdown-report-undertaker-makes-his-return-cody-rhodes-explains-his-sinister-plan-a-contract-signing-what-could-go-wrong-let-me-count-the-ways.html?p=1</a></p>
