Just a mad scramble that played up the innate stupidity of pole matches. Unlike ladder matches, winning here only required keeping your opponent down for a very brief time, leading both men taking every opportunity to attempt grabbing the contract on the pole. So, it was nothing but mad dashes and big bumps, which both men are quite adept at. The inability for either man to 'control' the contract took things to another level of insanity. There really couldn't be any other finish than Sheamus mocking them, saying that the match will be a triple threat, and then promising to kick their asses arses. One of those times where playing up the absurdity really paid off in a fun, entertaining way.<br><br>Rating: 8.0 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/244021">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/244021</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's WWE RAW Report 6.25.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Tony Acero on 06.25.2012 <br><br>Backstage, Alberto Del Rio is triyng to woo Vickie with words and roses. Del Rio tells Ricardo to go get a vase. Del Rio brings up the World Heavyweight Title, and here's Dolph Ziggler. He tells Del Rio that he's going to have to get in line. All Dolph needs is....ONE.....MORE....MATCH. Haha. Vickie says she wants to be fair and impartial. There will be a World Heavyweight Championship Contract on a Pole match tonight, and that title match will be Friday on Smackdown. Ricardo brings the case of flowers in, so Dolph sends them crashing against the wall. <br><br>Match 5: Alberto Del Rio vs. Dolph Ziggler<br>Dolph with a go behind then just runs up the pole, but Del Rio is quick to stop him. he stomps Dolph in the corner, then goes for the contract himself. Dolph with a right to the back of Del Rio. Del Rio with a whip to the corner. Dolph with an uppercut. Tilt-a-whirl backbreaker from Del Rio, though! He is up reaching for the contract, but Dolph stops him again. Side Russian Leg Sweep from Dolph. Dolph runs, Del Rio tries for another backbreaker, but Dolph hits a dropkick. Dolph goes for the Zig Zag, but Del Rio holds onto the ropes. Dolph rolls away, heads on the apron and runs up to get the contract, but Del RIo hangs Dolph up on the ropes. Del Rio is on the second turnbuckle, tries grabbing. Dolph runs up atop of Del Rio, but Del Rio sets him up on his shoulders and gets a Samoan drop. Ziggler gets up, he reaches for the contract! He grabs it off the pole, it drops on the mat, though. According to Cole, they not only have to grab it, they have to "control" it. They fight over it on the mat, exchange rights, then both men are down! Ricardo is in, he grabs it! Dolph with a dropkick, which sends it to the outside! Dolph and Del Rio realize this and both run for the outside. They trade getting close to it, then back out of the ring on the opposite side.<br><br>Winner: No Contest (*1/2)<br><br>The music of Sheamus hits, and he says that it's going to be a Triple Threat match this Friday for his title. So....the match prior to this was pointless? What the hell? I think someone messed up tonight, and this was just a cover.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/244017">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/244017</a> <br></p>
