                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2010-12-10 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2012-10-24 15:36:09+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2010, 战报, smackdown, rey_mysterio, edge, kane</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: KOFI AND DOLPH CONTINUE TO DELIVER IN THE RING; IS THIS TURNING INTO THE SHENANIGANS SHOW WITH THE TAG CHAMPS, AN EAGLE, A LEPRECHAUN, AND THE EDGE/KANE STUFF?; A NEW THREE MAN BOOTH</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2010-12-10 22:00:00</p><p>Tonight, continuing saga of Paul Bearer Held Hostage continues as Edge tries to keep Kane from his father. Alberto Del Rio gets to try to squash the cockroach Chihuahua Rey Mysterio and they will be in a tag match since they will be in separate matches at TLC.</p><p>We are live on tape from Dayton, Ohio and your announcers are Josh ‘Nutter’ Mathews, Matt ‘What Happened to Todd Grisham’ Striker, and Michael ‘I guess that RKO wasn’t as bad as I hoped’ Cole.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: Rey Mysterio and Edge versus Alberto Del Rio and Kane in a Isn’t this the match they have on the show before the pay per view match</strong></p><p>Before the match starts, Kane does not come out and Teddy Long tells Alberto that he will have to go it alone in a handicap match.</p><p>Rey starts off the match and Rey kicks Alberto in the leg and then he snap mares Del Rio and hits a leg drop and gets a near fall. Rey works on the arm and he kicks Alberto. Edge tags in and after an Irish whip hits a running shoulder followed by a drop kick into the corner by Rey. Alberto with elbows to Edge but Edge with a flapjack and then he tags in Rey. Edge and Rey with a spike wheelbarrow slam onto Alberto for a near fall. Rey with a forearm to Alberto followed by a kick. Rey with a drop kick to the knee and Alberto falls into the ropes so that means it is time for the 619, but Alberto gets to the floor but he cannot avoid a baseball slide that knocks Del Rio to the floor.</p><p>Kane comes out and Edge meets him on the ramp and they exchanges punches. Edge with a kick after escaping a choke slam and Edge goes to the back and Kane runs after him.</p><p>Alberto hits a distracted Rey Mysterio from behind and then Del Rio kicks Rey as it appears that the tag match that turned into a handicap match is now a singles match. Del Rio with a hard Irish whip and Rey goes down. Del Rio with a gut buster from the shoulders and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with a waist lock into a body scissors. Rey with an enzuigiri and then he gets sent to the apron and Del Rio hits his step up enzuigiri. Del Rio with a running knee to Rey on the floor and then he sends Rey into the announce table.</p><p>They return to the ring and Rey is on the apron while Alberto punches him. They go to the turnbuckles and Alberto tries for a superplex but Rey blocks it and he sends Del Rio to the mat. Rey with a seated splash and wheelbarrow into a bulldog for a near fall. Alberto with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker for a near fall. Alberto wants the referee to count faster and then Del Rio with a sunset flip but you never give Rey Mysterio a sunset flip because he rolls through and hits a seated splash followed by a drop kick to the back and you know where Alberto ends up. Rey hits the 619 and dive from the top turnbuckle for the three count.</p><p>Winners: Rey Mysterio and Edge</p><p>We see Edge in the back talking to what appears to be Paul Bearer on a table on top of two ladders. Edge tells him to be careful up there and hopes that he isn’t afraid of heights. Kane runs to the same spot and Edge runs away. Kane thinks it is another dummy and Edge tells Kane not to push over the chairs. Kane pushes the ladders over and he sees what he has done and Kane is speechless. We see Paul Bearer on the floor and people are trying to get some medical attention for him. Edge says that he told Kane as we go to credits.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=53464">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=53464</a>`</p>
