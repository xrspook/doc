And while The World’s Largest Athlete held on to the title, The Mexican Aristocrat, Sheamus and the entire locker room would end his 2012 with a bang — in the form of an earth-shattering Brogue Kick.</p><p>Big Show overcame Sheamus in a fierce Chairs Match at WWE TLC, but on the Christmas Eve episode of Raw, Sheamus beat Big Show in the first-ever Lumber-Jack Frost Match, leaving a question as to whether the Irish Superstar had earned another opportunity at the gigantic titleholder.</p><p>Sheamus opened SmackDown in the wake of his victory, still savoring the joyful spirit of the holiday season and the festive beating he gave The World’s Largest Athlete four days earlier. Sharing his New Year’s resolution that he would win back the World Title, The Celtic Warrior proposed they have their championship match right there in Rochester! The emerging Big Show made light of Sheamus’ win, refusing the challenge by giving his opinion that the Irish Superstar would always come up short when it counted.</p><p>SmackDown General Manager Booker T interrupted. And following The World’s Largest Athlete’s bold statement that no Superstar in the locker room was worthy of facing him for the Word Title, the head of the blue brand declared that every one of their names would be entered into a lottery to determine Big Show’s opponent in a World Heavyweight Title Match on SmackDown!<br></p><p>In the midst of a power struggle between Theodore Long and Eve to see who would draw the name of Big Show’s No. 1 contender, the lottery tumbler suddenly toppled onto the floor. A frustrated Booker took control of the situation and picked Santino Marella as the Superstar who would face the giant challenge.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-12-28/results-26080274">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-12-28/results-26080274</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Big Show taken down by Del Rio, Sheamus and a slew of WWE Superstars on the final SmackDown of 2012</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>December 28, 2012</p><p><strong>After Santino hurt himself, Alberto Del Rio named Big Show’s challenger for the World Heavyweight Title tonight.</strong></p><p></p><p>Though he had been selected to face Big Show for the World Title, Santino Marella pulled a hamstring trying to learn the Brogue Kick from Sheamus and could no longer compete.</p><p>Despite the protest of Big Show, Booker drew again. While the WWE Universe learned Ricardo Rodriguez had been selected to take over where The Milan Miracle left off, Big Show quickly KO Punched the replacement out of action.</p><p>When an outraged Alberto Del Rio heard his ring announcer had been knocked out, he rushed to his side. Booker opted to give Del Rio the opportunity at getting retribution and Big Show’s World Title at the same time.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-12-28/results-26080274/page-6">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-12-28/results-26080274/page-6</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Big Show taken down by Del Rio, Sheamus and a slew of WWE Superstars on the final SmackDown of 2012</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>December 28, 2012</p><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion Big Show def. Alberto Del Rio by Disqualification in a World Heavyweight Title Match</strong></p><p></p><p>Prior to the SmackDown main event, a completely irritated Big Show complained about having to defend his title under such ridiculous circumstances. That didn’t stop The World’s Largest Athlete from bringing the excruciating fight to his impromptu No. 1 contender after the opening bell in a rare World Heavyweight Title Match on the blue brand.</p><p>When Del Rio gained the momentum and looked to be loosening up the giant for the Cross Armbreaker, though, Big Show decided to take a walk. As he walked up the ramp, Sheamus emerged to attack the retreating champion. While he was able to knock down The Celtic Warrior and pick up the win by disqualification, Show’s escape was still blocked by the sudden materialization of a slew of Superstars — the very group he had made light of earlier as a bunch of "losers" and "rejects."</p><p>The massive opposition launched Big Show back into the ring. And after Del Rio stunned Big Show with a kick, Sheamus hit the Brogue Kick on the World Heavyweight Champion, cutting the towering grappler down to the size.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-12-28/results-26080274/page-9">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-12-28/results-26080274/page-9</a></p>
