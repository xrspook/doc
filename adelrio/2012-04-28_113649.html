Plus, Cody Rhodes used Extreme measures on Intercontinental Champion Big Show and Randy Orton "familiarized" Jinder Mahal with the rules and regulations of Permanent Raw and SmackDown General Manager John Laurinaitis.<br><br>Celebrating the fact that he “finally got rid of AJ” one week ago, Daniel Bryan went on to claim that his 18 second loss to Sheamus at WrestleMania “does not count.” Insisting that it should instead be counted as his ex-girlfriend’s loss, SmackDown’s resident “YES”-man once again promised to soundly defeat the World Heavyweight Champion in a 2-out-of-3 Falls Match at Extreme Rules (MATCH PREVIEW)<br><br>Bryan then turned his attention to Monday’s Raw SuperShow. In regard to his controversial actions as guest referee – in a match between The Celtic Warrior and Mark Henry – Bryan produced slow-motion footage, attempting to purity his fast three-count that cost Sheamus the contest. He then justified putting his adversary in a post-match Yes Lock as an act of self defense once The Great White lost his cool.<br><br>Did Alberto Del Rio then interrupt the submission specialist? “YES!” The Mexican Aristocrat wasted no time reasserting himself as a top contender for the World Heavyweight Title, as his personal ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez played on Bryan’s catchphrase by repeatedly shouting “Si!” Intercontinental Champion Big Show soon joined the party, sending both Del Rio and Bryan heading for the hills with the mere promise of the WMD. The petrified Rodriguez wasn’t so lucky, however, as he was summarily chokeslammed by The World’s Largest Athlete.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-04-27/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-04-27/results</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: Sheamus bested Henry in a prelude to the Extreme<br></strong><br>BY Michael Burdick April 27, 2012<br><br><strong>Big Show def. Alberto Del Rio by Disqualification</strong><br><br>Just when Big Show looked ready to finish Alberto Del Rio with a chokeslam, Cody Rhodes attacked him from behind. This gave the giant a victory by disqualification, yet the fireworks were just getting started.<br><br>Although Rhodes attempted to hit Show with a Kendo Stick after the bell, anger seemed to be the only effort he provoked from the giant. He then tried to wield a steel chair, only to have it punched out of his hand. Refusing to give up his advantage, the grandson of a plumber took off his belt to use as a weapon. However, before he could, the World’s Largest Intercontinental Champion delivered a fierce kick, yanking the belt out of Rhodes' hand before turning it on its owner.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-04-27/results/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-04-27/results/page-2</a> <br></p>
