We then see the footage from Orton’s match against Big Show on Main Event.</p><p>Del Rio says that Randy Orton is not a viper. He is not the apex predator because Alberto Del Rio is the new apex predator in the WWE. Orton is nothing but a slimy garden snake with no cajones to show his face tonight.
