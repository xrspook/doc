What does CM Punk have in store for the show where they fight on Friday night?</p><p>We are in Topeka, Kansas and your announcers are John ‘Rock Chalk Justin Hawk’ Layfield and Michael ‘How can we be so close to Manhattan when we are in Kansas’ Cole.</p><p>Our special guest makes his way to the ring so CM Punk can address the crowd. Before that happens, we see what happened on Raw when CM Punk and Curtis Axel were part of a tag team match against Darren Young and Titus O’Neil.</p><p>Punk stands under the blue briefcase and he waits for the crowd to quiet down.</p><p>He says that if he was John Cena, he would give a very heartfelt speech about the Fourth of July and how much it means to be an American and how America was built on hustle, loyalty, and respect. Punk reminds everyone that he is not John Cena and he has a drastically different point of view than Cena.</p><p>He says that the Fourth of July means independence to him. It is a time when like minded individuals decided that they were not going to conform to someone else’s rules. They were going to make their own rules and blaze their own trail and die for it if necessary.</p><p>Punk says that independence is important to him and if someone tells him that he has a series of rules to follow, he will break them. If he is told something and even if it was a smart idea, he was going to run away from it. When he was told that he would be the biggest thing after Wrestlemania, but he walked away. When he was told that Paul Heyman was a major asset for him at ringside, he told Paul to stay in the back.</p><p>Regardless of how good his track record is in Money in the Bank matches, he was told that the odds were against him in the All-Stars Money in the Bank match. That is why he lined everyone up and told them what he thought of them to prove them wrong.</p><p>He is a simple guy with simple needs. He has two simple goals. The first one is to get his hands on Brock Lesnar. He will get his hands on Brock and hold him accountable for the F-5 that Brock gave him on Raw. His second goal . . . and he looks at the briefcase and it is to win the Money in the Bank match and become WWE Champion again.</p><p>He says that those are his two basic goals and he has no problem telling everyone.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and Punk mentions that he is not done.</p><p>Alberto says that he was expecting more from CM Punk.</p><p>Punk says that Del Rio was expecting more from him, but Punk says that he was expecting more from Del Rio, like a cool car. Instead it is just him in a cheap suit. He wants to know what Del Rio wants.</p><p>Del Rio says that it is not about what he wants, it is about who he is. He is the World Heavyweight Champion. This is his show.</p><p>Punk agrees that Del Rio is the World Champion, but title or no title, it has never been his show. They air on Mundos and it isn’t even Del Rio’s show. He wants to know what Del Rio wants.</p><p>Del Rio says that Punk is always making jokes. He asks Punk if they know how his people celebrated their holiday. They stuffed their faces in their backyards eating hot dogs, hamburgers, and French fries. They celebrate their freedom by watching television all day and play with the internet. They get fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter every day. Then they come to Smackdown and they cheer a filthy little pig named Dolph Ziggler who disrespected the Mexican culture and ruined his fiesta.</p><p>Then they chant USA (and the crowd starts the chant). They chant USA because they are nothing but a bunch of sheep.</p><p>Punk asks Alberto if he is the same guy who came out and championed how awesome America was until a few weeks ago. He was starting the USA chants talking about how fantastic America is. Now he is criticizing them because they saw through his Born in Mexico, Made in America crap?</p><p>They chant USA and boo Del Rio, not because he is from Mexico. It is because he tried to put on this façade and acted like a phony America. They see through him and they see Del Rio as the phony he is.</p><p>Del Rio says that Punk is always barking. He calls Punk a Chihuahua and someone needs to teach him some manners. Del Rio reminds Punk that he is the World . . . Heavyweight . . . Champion.</p><p>Punk tells Del Rio that he is the number one contender to his title of Best in the World. He doesn’t chase Del Rio, Del Rio chases him. He doesn’t interrupt Del Rio, it was Alberto who interrupted him.</p><p>Alberto says that this is his world, his show, and his ring. He orders Punk to leave right now.</p><p>Punk says that it sounds painfully like Alberto is telling him to do something. Punk says that it might be smart, but he is going to stay in the ring until Del Rio makes him leave the ring.</p><p>As we approach TeddyCon 2, it is time for Teddy Long’s music to play and he has an even number of people in the ring so we might be getting a match for later in the show.</p><p>Teddy tells the playas to wait a minute. He says that we had fireworks for the Fourth of July, but thanks to Del Rio and Punk, we are going to have fireworks in the main event. Alberto Del Rio will face CM Punk.</p><p>We are back and Dolph Ziggler makes his way to the ring. We see footage from the WWE App showing some possible tension between Dolph and AJ Lee over the situation with Kaitlyn.</p><p>Dolph says that the last few months have been a blur. There is one thing and one memory that he will never forget. The night that he defeated Alberto Del Rio to become the World Champion. After that, things get a little fuzzy. He just came back from a concussion and he had a giant target on his head and Del Rio took advantage of that. He does not remember too much after that.</p><p>This is not ballet. What he does remember is a giant cheesy grin on Del Rio’s face while flailing his arms around. He talked about how much he loved America. He could not do the impossible. He could not convince you that he was likeable. Del Rio is full of crap. Dolph says that he might be a lot of things, but he does not claim to be something he is not. He might have a chip on his shoulder. You might say that he is cocky or arrogant but he does things that nobody else does in the ring.</p><p>At Money in the Bank, he is taking back what is rightfully his, the World Heavyweight Championship.</p><p><strong>Match Number Six: CM Punk versus Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>They lock up and Punk backs Del Rio into the turnbuckles and he gives a clean break. Del Rio with punches and kicks but Punk puts Del Rio in the corner and connects with shoulders. Punk with a snap mare and drop kick to the back of the head. Punk with a punch to the ribs. Punk with a forearm but Del Rio with a kick to the ribs.</p><p>Del Rio with punches and the referee warns him. Del Rio with an Irish whip but he misses a splash into the corner. Punk with a knee into the corner followed by a short arm clothesline. Punk goes up top for the elbow drop but Del Rio rolls to the floor. We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Del Rio with an enzuigiri to the shoulder and he applies an arm bar. Punk with an arm drag to escape the arm bar. Punk with a shoulder in the corner but Punk appears to have done more damage to his arm. Del Rio with a kick to Punk and he gets a near fall.</p><p>Del Rio wraps Punk’s arm in the ropes and the referee warns him. Del Rio with punches to the arm and he returns to the arm bar. Punk gets Del Rio on his shoulders but Del Rio escapes and he hits an arm breaker and gets a near fall. Del Rio with a super kick and he gets a near fall. Del Rio returns to the arm bar. Punk gets to his feet and he connects with forearms. Punk with a slam and he goes to the turnbuckles. Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri but he can only get a two count.</p><p>Del Rio tries to float over into the cross arm breaker but Punk escapes and he kicks Del Rio and connects with forearms. Punk with a clothesline but Del Rio with a tilt-a-whirl back breaker. Del Rio with a baseball slide that sends Punk to the floor. Punk tries for the Go To Sleep on the floor but Del Rio escapes and he sends Punk into the ringside barrier and then he sends Punk over the announce table.</p><p>Del Rio readjusts the announce table but Heyman says something to Del Rio and Del Rio punches him. Del Rio stands over Heyman and then Punk hits a double sledge off the table onto Del Rio. Punk attacks Del Rio and the referee calls for the bell.</p><p>Double Count Out</p><p>Punk sends Del Rio into the ringside barrier and then he sends Del Rio back into the ring. Punk picks up Del Rio and he hits the Go To Sleep.</p><p>We go to credits with Heyman apologizing to Punk.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/78722/wwe-smackdown-report-cm-punk-and-dolph-ziggler-talk-about-alberto-del-rio-teddy-long-sees-people-in-a-ring-and-makes-a-match-3mb-cannot-capture-the-ziggler-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/78722/wwe-smackdown-report-cm-punk-and-dolph-ziggler-talk-about-alberto-del-rio-teddy-long-sees-people-in-a-ring-and-makes-a-match-3mb-cannot-capture-the-ziggler-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
