On the sixty-ninth anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, we start the fourth season of NXT and after what turned out to be an okay third season of female rookies after a very slow start. This time we have six male rookies. The big question going into Season Four is if the announcing will as inconsequential as it was during season three with Michael Cole and his new mirror image Josh Mathews.</p><p>We are live on tape on the internet and your announcers are Todd '˜I Hope I Care' Grisham and Josh '˜Minor Cole Miner' Mathews. Your host is Matt '˜The Saving Grace of Season Three' Striker.</p><p>Matt introduces the pros. R Truth comes out first and he asks and then he brings out his rookie. He says that this is the hottest guy since grits, Johnny Curtis. Ted DiBiase and Maryse are out next and Ted introduces the biggest, most intimidating powerhouse ever to be on NXT, Brodus Clay. Chris Masters comes out and he appears to have forgotten his shirt and introduction by Matt Striker. He says that his rookie is a bit brash and cocky. He might not be a masterpiece, but he comes close. He introduces Byron Saxton.</p><p>Dolph Ziggler comes out and he forgot a shirt but has a jacket. He says that he is awesome at what he does and if his rookie listens, he will be almost as good as him. He introduces his rookie Jacob Novak. Jacob also has the jacket and no shirt look going on. The next pro is Season One rookie Daniel Bryan. He brings out his rookie who is manly, so manly oh so manly that his name is Derrick Bateman.

He says that everyone is watching what they are doing. There will be voting from the pros and WWE Universe. The winner of NXT will earn a Championship match.</p><p>It is time for our rookies to introduce themselves to the world.</p><p>Johnny Curtis says that he wants to do something different.

Together they will become WWE's next breakout star.</p><p>Jacob Novak wants to ask the universe if they grew up playing board games. His board game of choice was Monopoly because you got to own your competition and that is what he is going to do on Season Four. He will own the board.</p><p>Derrick Bateman wants to mentions that he is honored and privileged to debut in his home state of Ohio. Today is a day that will live in infamy because it is NXT Season Four. He is the superstar who is Mantastic.</p><p>Conor O'Brian says hey to Ohio. He says that he has been made fun of his entire life because he looks like a rat. Rats are survivors because they strike at the right moment. He says that takes the cheese.</p><p>Alberto tells Conor that if he is going to be his rookie, he needs to do a better job because he is boring. He says that Conor is just like Daniel Bryan.</p><p>Bryan tells Conor not to listen to Del Rio. He says that O'Brian did okay even though he looks like a rat. Bryan says that Del Rio is jealous because he has never won a title.</p><p>Matt gets between Alberto and Daniel and we are going to have a tag match with Alberto and Conor O'Brian versus Derrick Bateman and Daniel Bryan.</p><p>Todd and Josh talk about the promos and it is time to take a look at the Byron Saxton video package.</p><p>Bryon is from Virginia and he says that he is better because he had a privileged background. He always listened to his parents and never missed a day of school. Since he was four years old, he knew this is what he wanted to do. He was a newscaster in the past and he calls himself a multimedia man. Byron says that NXT is an opportunity after his time on ECW came crashing down.
