BROTHER</strong><br><br>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-04-09 23:03:17<br><br>We are live from Washington, D.C. and your announcers are Michael ‘Daniel Snyder of WWE’ Cole and Jerry ‘Ovechkin’ Lawler.<br><br>We see what happened last week on Smackdown when Sheamus attacked Chad Patton (sorry, thought it was Mike Chioda as I mentioned on the Smackdown post game show)<br><br>Match Number Five: Zack Ryder versus Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez<br><br>Del Rio with forearms and kicks to Ryder and he gets a near fall. Del Rio with a snap mare and a drop kick to the head for a near fall. Del Rio with kicks to the ribs in the corner and then he tries to smother Ryder in the corner.<br><br>Del Rio runs into boots from Ryder and then Ryder sets for the running boot to the head and he waits for Del Rio to get up for the Rough Ryder but Del Rio sends Ryder into the turnbuckles and Del Rio with the float over into the cross arm breaker and Ryder taps out.<br><br>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/67519/wwe-raw-report-john-cena-has-a-rough-night-so-does-cm-punk-santino-hitches-his-cobra-to-the-right-guy-will-sasso-is-the-man-brother.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/67519/wwe-raw-report-john-cena-has-a-rough-night-so-does-cm-punk-santino-hitches-his-cobra-to-the-right-guy-will-sasso-is-the-man-brother.html?p=1</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's WWE RAW Report 04.09.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Greg De Marco on 04.09.2012<br><br>Brock Lesnar bloodies John Cena, Chris Jericho continues to get the better of CM Punk, Lord Tensai wrestles a real Japanese wrestler, and RAW gets Stooged! Get all the details inside 411's WWE RAW Report!<br><br>B.A.Star. ... WOO! WOO! WOO! ... Ricardo Rodriguez. Means one thing.<br><br>Smackdown highlights? By the way, I don't think ADR pulled the famous Eddie trick. I think he won on accident. And that set Sheamus off.<br><br><br>Zack Ryder vs. Alberto Del Rio<br>ADR immediately pounces on Ryder. Seated dropkick for two. Del Rio beats on Ryder in the corner, working over his arm in the process—nice bit of psychology. Ryder reverses fortune, connecting with the Broski Boot. Rough Ryder is avoided, allowing Del Rio to slap on the cross arm breaker.<br>Winner: Alberto Del Rio (submission, 1:24)<br><br>Del Rio wipes his nose with Rider's wristband.<br><br>I liked the match, but I was looking forward to a longer match that would have put Ryder over in a loss. But Del Rio has a PPV title shot coming up, right off of a return. So it makes sense.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/233214">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/233214</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's Instant Analysis 04.09.12: WWE Monday Night Raw</strong><br><br>Posted by Chad Nevett on 04.09.2012<br><br>What did we think of John Cena and Brock Lesnar's brawl, CM Punk again defending the WWE Title against Mark Henry, special guest stars the Three Stooges and more? Check out 411's RAW Instant Analysis to find out!<br><br>SEGMENT SIX: Alberto Del Rio vs. Zack Ryder<br>Match Result: Alberto Del Rio made Zack Ryder tap out<br>Match Length: A little less than a minute and a half<br><br>Huh. Ryder dominates. Del Rio counters and applies submission hold. Del Rio wins. Not much to this. I didn't particularly like this, but I didn't hate it either. I didn't care. That's the worst reaction, isn't it?<br><br>Rating: "What number out of 10 does 'bored apathy' fall under?" out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/233215">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/233215</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Raw Deal April 9: Brock Lesnar Bloodies John Cena</strong><br><br>By John Canton (Featured Columnist) on April 10, 2012<br><br>Zack Ryder vs. Alberto Del Rio<br><br>Del Rio's getting a title shot against Sheamus, so of course he got the easy win here. Is Ryder going to try to get revenge on Kane for putting him in a wheelchair, or is that angle completely dropped? I guess it's been completely forgotten except by those of us with an actual memory.<br><br>They worked a quick match. Ryder made a comeback with the Broski Boot. His Rough Ryder didn't work, though, as Del Rio threw him into the turnbuckle and gave him the Cross Armbreaker leading to Ryder tapping out after a total match time of about 90 seconds.<br><br>Winner: Alberto Del Rio<br><br>Analysis: 1/2* Another squash match. At least Ryder got in a move before he lost. I say it every week. Ryder is probably the most poorly booked character in all of WWE.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1140281-wwe-raw-deal-april-9-brock-lesnar-bloodies-john-cena">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1140281-wwe-raw-deal-april-9-brock-lesnar-bloodies-john-cena</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Raw: Brock Lesnar Bloodies John Cena, Jericho's Games Continue and More</strong><br><br>By Kyle Schadler (Senior Analyst) on April 10, 2012<br><br>Zack Ryder vs. Alberto Del Rio<br><br>Despite hitting the Broski Boot, this was an overall squash match that saw the Long Island Iced Z quickly tap out to Del Rio’s cross armbreaker.<br><br>I’m glad to see Del Rio back as it adds some much-needed depth to the main event scene. He’s still boring on the mic, but his in-ring ability is top-notch.<br><br>As for Ryder, it’s very disappointing to see him in this position. He was on top of the world late last year, but he has fallen so hard since then.<br><br>I personally blame Eve. As soon as he was paired up with her, things started to go downhill.<br><br>I’d like to think that his bad luck as of late will be leading to something big, though.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1139148-wwe-raw-brock-lesnar-bloodies-john-cena-jerichos-games-continue-and-more">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1139148-wwe-raw-brock-lesnar-bloodies-john-cena-jerichos-games-continue-and-more</a> </p><blockquote><p><strong>The Doctor's Weekly WWE Raw Recap: The 148 Things We Learned, Loved and Hated</strong><br><br>By Chris Mueller AKA The Doctor (Featured Columnist) on April 10, 2012<br><br>98. Zack Ryder comes out after commercial for a match.<br>99. His most recent storyline seems to have left him in a bit of a limbo state. I am not sure if he will be back to being a prime-time player again anytime soon.<br>100. Alberto Del Rio is his opponent, and he comes out in a beautiful looking Mercedes.<br>101. Does anyone else wonder why the steel chair became the weapon of choice for wrestlers?<br>102. We get a replay of last week when Sheamus lost to Del Rio by DQ.<br>103. Del Rio starts off strong against Ryder.<br>104. Ryder hits a very stiff-looking Broski Boot at one point.<br>105. Del Rio comes back and locks in his finisher to make Ryder tap for the win.<br>106. I guess Ryder is no longer being pushed. That was basically a squash.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1139096-the-doctors-weekly-wwe-raw-recap-the-148-things-we-learned-loved-and-hated">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1139096-the-doctors-weekly-wwe-raw-recap-the-148-things-we-learned-loved-and-hated</a> <br></p>
