He said that whoever wins the Battle Royal gets to become the new WWE Intercontinental champion, but he has some bad news. He said that being the new champion will be like retiring here in Florida. It will be be great in the beginning but it’s just delaying the inevitable, that they will meet their demise at the hands of his Bullhammer.</p><p>They all went after Khali first but he fought off the entire ring and began chopping away. He tossed Woods and Ryder. Sheamus nailed Khali with the Brogue Kick and everyone teamed to toss the big man.</p><p>Ziggler was almost tossed but hung on. Dallas tossed Cara. Everyone started tossing everyone. Everyone that was left was laid out so Sheamus and Ryback could face off and start battling back and forth. They battled until Sheamus nailed a Brogue Kick on Ryback, sending him over the top. Miz tried to sneak in and tossed Sheamus but was nailed. Miz rolled under the ropes to the floor, so he’s doing the Jimmy Hart hide under the ring spot.</p><p>Bo tossed O’Neil over and did his running around bit. Cesaro and Kingston had some good exchanges. Del Rio killed Ziggler with a backbreaker. It’s starting to pick up. Del Rio, on the outside, missed a kick and Ziggler, snapped him on the ropes, eliminating him.</p><p>Big E pressed Cesaro but Cesaro slipped out and used a belly to belly to eliminate him. Cesaro tossed Kingston over but he landed on Big E’s shoulders to save himself. They did some really good near elimination spots before Cesaro finally tossed him out with a delayed vertical suplex.</p><p>In a big shock, Heath Slater nailed Cesaro from behind and tossed him out. That got a huge pop. Sheamus killed him with a Brogue Kick and eliminated him. Bo Dallas tried to toss Sheamus but it didn’t work out so well for him as he was beaten across the chest and dropkicked out by Ziggler. It came down to Ziggler and Sheamus (and Miz on the floor hiding). They battled back and forth. Ziggler went for the Famouser but something went amiss and instead he landed on top and rained down with punches.</p><p>Sheamus went for a powerbomb but Ziggler turned it into a sunset flip deal. Sheamus missed the Famouser but caught Ziggler with a catapult that sent him over the top to the apron. Sheamus worked over Ziggler on the apron. The crowd was really behind Ziggler. They battled on the apron. Sheamus went for the shoulderblock into the ring but Ziggler superkicked him and knocked him to the floor.</p><p>Miz hit the ring and tossed Ziggler out, winning.</p><p>Your winner and new WWE Intercontinental champion, The Miz!</p><p>As soon as they were done with the early eliminations, there were some really entertaining sequences.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=87054">http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=87054</a></p>
