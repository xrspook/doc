YES!!!!!</strong><br><br>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-07-02 23:05:10<br><br>This week’s show starts off with footage from the main event between John Cena and Chris Jericho, and Big Show’s interference in the match and his attack on John Cena.<br><br>We are live from Laredo, Texas and your announcers are Michael ‘Roman Candle’ Cole and Jerry ‘Is Dennis Stamp booked for tonight’ Lawler. <br><br>Teddy is in his office and he is dancing.<br><br>Alberto enters and he says that he is glad that Teddy is back in control. Alberto reminds Teddy that he earned his title match right after Wrestlemania. He has been put into different matches. Alberto demands what he deserves.<br><br>Teddy says that Alberto does not deserve anything, but the Board has named him the number one contender. Teddy says that Alberto will be in a match . . . and it is next. Alberto says that he wants to know, but Teddy tells Alberto it is a surprise.<br><br>We go to commercial.<br><br>We are back with a Raw 1000 Memorable Moment. It is Stephanie McMahon’s pick for Shane helping her father . . . Vince McMahon get ready for his match against Steve Austin in 1999.<br><br>Match Number Two: Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez versus Sin Cara<br><br>Del Rio with a kick to the head when Sin Cara slides into the ring. Del Rio sends Cara into the turnbuckles and then he goes to the floor after Cara and stomps on Cara from the apron. Del Rio applies the cross arm breaker and Cara taps even though there is no match. The referee tries to pull Del Rio off Cara and it takes two to do the job. <br><br>We are back with another Raw 1000 Memorable Moment: It is from Alberto Del Rio and it is the night that DX invaded Nitro. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=69835"></a><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=69835">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=69835</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's Instant Analysis 07.02.12: WWE Monday Night Raw<br></strong><br>Posted by Chad Nevett on 07.02.2012<br><br>SEGMENT THREE: Alberto Del Rio vs. Destroys Sin Cara<br><br>Meant as Teddy Long's surprise for Del Rio, Sin Cara turned out to not be much of a threat as Del Rio attacked him mid-entrance and just beat the holy hell out of him. A decent way to make Del Rio seem imposing and more of a heel, especially for the near-the-Mexican-border audience. Given Del Rio's lack of success against Sheamus, he needs to be built up somewhat to be a believable threat at Money in the Bank and this is a good first step.<br><br>Rating: 6.5 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/244951">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/244951</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411’s WWE Raw Report 7.02.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Larry Csonka on 07.02.2012 <br><br>-Teddy Long dances backstage, and Alberto Del Rio is there to kiss up to Long. Del Rio says that he wants to say he earned a world title match right after WM, but it always gets changed. That's not fair. Long doesn't think he deserves it, but the board of directors have stated that Del Rio will get a match against Sheamus at the MITB PPV. Long says he will be in a match, next. Long says he will find out who his opponent is when he gets out there.<br><br>-Raw memories, and we see Shane McMahon training Vince for his Royal Rumble appearance. This is Stephanie's favorite moment by the way.<br><br>-Cole thanks the fans for making Raw a success, and in three weeks, they go to three hours.<br><br>Alberto Del Rio vs. Sin Cara<br><br>As Cara made his entrance, Del Rio attacks him and started to beat him down. He tossed him to the floor and then beat him down more and applied the arm bar. The match did not officially start, and they finally got Del Rio to break the hold. I know I am not the only one thinking it, but, another wellness suspension, or just making Del Rio appear strong? You decide.<br><br>OFFICIAL RESULT: No Contest<br><br>-We get another Raw moment, which is DX invading WCW. This is Alberto Del Rio's moment. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/244947">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/244947</a> <br></p>
