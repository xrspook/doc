Our thoughts are with all of you. A few of us from the site are in the path as well, so let's all hope for the best.</p><p>Welcome to PWInsider.com's live, ongoing coverage of the 2012 WWE Hell in A Cell PPV from Atlanta, GA at the Phillips Arena!</p><p><strong>Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>They locked up and Orton took the early control with an uppercut and several shots in the corner. He tossed Alberto to the outside and caught him with a clothesline on the floor. Orton slammed Del Rio into the table and then into the ringpost.</p><p>Orton tossed Alberto back into the ring and began nailing him with the Garvin Stomp. Orton continued working over Del Rio in the corner. Del Rio tossed him over the top but he landed on his feet on the apron. Ricardo tried to distract Orton, allowing Del Rio to smash Orton's arm over the turnbuckle post.</p><p>Del Rio began focusing on Orton's arm, softening him up for the rolling cross armbreaker. Orton fought back in the corner but Del Rio hung over the ropes, pulling on the left arm. Alberto then sent Orton into the corner shoulder-first.</p><p>Orton was worked over and tried to roll up Del Rio for a near fall. Del Rio broke free and continued focusing on Orton's arm, locking on a submission. Orton began firing with a series of rights in an attempt to break free but was cut off. Del Rio maneuvered him towards the ropes and hung himself upside down to force more pressure on his arbar. He broke the hold due to the referee's count, allowing Orton to dump him to the floor.</p><p>Alberto returned with Orton hitting some offense, only to be caught with the cross armbreaker out of a powerslam attempt. Orton made it to the ropes to break the hold. Orton caught Del Rio for another near fall. Del Rio rolled to the outside but was caught and pulled into the ring for the hanging DDT. Del Rio escaped and nailed a Stun Gun on Orton.</p><p>Alberto began pounding on the mat to mock Orton. He went for an RKO but Orton sent him to the outside, then nailed the hanging DDT off the ropes. Now Orton was setting up for the RKO but his arm was hurting when he pounded the mat.</p><p>Orton went for the RKO but Alberto countered it with a backstabber for a near fall. Orton shocked him with a powerslam for a two count. Orton placed Del Rio on the top but was shoved down. He was caught up in the ropes. Alberto came off with a double stomp to the chest for another two count.</p><p>Orton made a comeback but was captured with a cross armbreaker. Orton tried to fight it off but Del Rio sunk the move in in the center of the ring. Orton turned it into a pinning combination for a two count.</p><p>Del Rio charged Orton, who was in the corner for the leaping enziguiri. Orton ducked and caught Del Rio with the RKO as he twisted in the air. Orton scored the pin.</p><p>Your winner, Randy Orton!</p><p>Good back and forth opener to start the show. Both looked really good and they told a nice story in the ring. The finish was real good. Entertaining stuff.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/72961/complete-wwe-hell-in-a-cell-ppv-coverage.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/72961/complete-wwe-hell-in-a-cell-ppv-coverage.html?p=1</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>HELL IN A CELL PPV BLOG</strong></p><p>By Dave Scherer on 2012-10-28 20:01:15</p><p>Welcome to my Hell In A Cell PPV blog. I would tell you whether I am looking forward to the show or not but believe or not, there are a few people on the message board who think for some bizarre reason that if you are not looking forward to a show going in to it, you can't be impartial when you write about it. Yeah, that doesn't make sense to me either when I have already given my opinion on audio, the Newsletter and the Tip Sheet concerning how I feel about a show but hey, it must make sense to them!</p><p>With that said, I will now tell you what my thoughts are going in (yeah, I hate message boards, what can I say). While I don't think the build for this show has been good I have to say I am very interested to see how they book the main event. I am curious to see what they do with Ryback and whether they can realize that a strong CM Punk is a good CM Punk. We shall see. ... Oh yeah, once again I refused to pay the extra 10 bucks for HD. To me that is a travesty. SD looks good enough on a 51" plasma.</p><p>We are opening with Alberto Del Rio vs. Randy Orton. The announce team is Michael Cole, Jim Ross and JBL. I figured we would star with Miz vs. Kofi. ... It's back and forth early until ADR gets control and starts working on Orton's forearm. After a few minutes, Orton breaks free and uses the right arm for clotheslines. ADR then locked on the cross arm breaker but Orton fights back as a one-armed man. ... With Orton down, ADR mocks him by viping on the mat. This let's Orton get a DDT off of the ropes and take control. Cole uses "vintage" for the first time.</p><p>Ah, but Orton screwed up. As he went to vipe he hit the mat and hurt his hurt arm so ADR is back in control. Briefly as Orton got a two with a powerslam. ADR gets a two count with a sick move off of the top. Back and forth they go until Orton goes for Ricardo. ADR uses that to lock on the armbreaker. Orton does his best to break it finally and finally rolled ADR for the two. Ricardo let go and Orton pulled the RKO out of nowhere for the win.</p><p>The match itself was really good. I don't get why they put the made guy over when ADR really needed the win here. Orton was hurt and it wouldn't have hurt him a bit to lose, but he won. Meanwhile, ADR really needed a win, and he lost.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=72962">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=72962</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
