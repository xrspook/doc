Team Del Rio (Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match)</strong></p><p>November 21, 2010</p><p>MIAMI - The key to victory in a Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match is teamwork and that's exactly what Rey Mysterio's crew relied on tonight in their win over the underhanded Alberto Del Rio and his sleazy SmackDown squad. Proving that he truly is The Ultimate Underdog, Mysterio led his team to triumph by pinning Jack Swagger before helping Big Show lay waste to Drew McIntyre.</p><p>The failure of Team Del Rio to find success tonight can be pinned directly on their cowardly captain. Perhaps the most selfish Superstar on the WWE roster, Del Rio took himself out of the heated bout after getting plastered by The World's Largest Athlete's Knockout Punch, leaving "Dashing" Cody Rhodes, Tyler Reks, Swagger and McIntyre to fend for themselves. The act was gutless, but shouldn't have surprised anyone. After all, the arrogant aristocrat abandoned Team SmackDown in their match against Team Raw at WWE Bragging Rights and ran from a showdown with The Nexus two weeks ago on SmackDown.</p><p>Unlike his disgraceful rival, Mysterio was the perfect leader for his team of Big Show, Kofi Kingston, MVP and Chris Masters. Although their side suffered the first eliminations when The Ballin' Superstar and The Masterpiece went down, they kept their focus and rallied back by dispensing of Del Rio, Rhodes and Reks. After Swagger managed to stop Kingston with the ankle lock, Mysterio and Show secured the win by taking out The All-American American and the Scottish Superstar in the blink of an eye.</p><p>As the Superstars who survived tonight's bout and Friday's 10-Man Battle Royal, Mysterio and Show again proved they are two of WWE's top competitors. But the real story coming out of the American Airlines Arena is Del Rio's spineless leadership. Will this wealthy Superstar not stop until he's made an enemy of everyone on the WWE roster?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/currentepisode/16306666">http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/currentepisode/16306666</a></p>
