With the ring adorned in decorations and accompanied by the sounds of a Mariachi band, Del Rio welcomed the San Antonio crowd to “Fiesta Del Rio”!</p><p></p><p>Dolph Ziggler, AJ Lee and Big E Langston soon crashed the party, and using Big E as leverage, The Showoff threatened to cash in his Money in the Bank contract right then and there. A furiously silent Big Show arrived on the scene, tipping the scales even further against the Mexican Superstar — just nine days before his World Title rematch at the Royal Rumble.</p><p>But Sheamus quickly evened the odds, and putting aside their differences, The Celtic Warrior congratulated Del Rio on his title victory, shaking his former rival’s hand and offering his services as the “bouncer” for Del Rio’sfiesta.</p><p>Before things got out of hand, General Manager Booker T joined the party by making a mega match for the night — Big Show & Dolph Ziggler against Del Rio & Sheamus!</p><p>Ordering the opposition out of the ring, Booker answered Del Rio’s call for a Spinaroonie, and with a reluctant jig from The Celtic Warrior, the party was officially underway.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-01-18/results-26085374">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-01-18/results-26085374</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio & Sheamus def. Big Show & Dolph Ziggler via Count-out</strong></p><p>A huge night of SmackDown action was capped off with a massive main event, as World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio joined forces with Sheamus to square off against Big Show & Dolph Ziggler in an epic tag team bout. But with Big E Langston and AJ Lee at ringside, the match was frenzied from the get-go as both of Ziggler’s “friends” were ejected from the arena by the referee.</p><p>At the height of the action, Sheamus built up momentum against Ziggler, but when The Celtic Warrior looked to hit a high impact move off the top rope, Big Show tossed him to the ringside floor. The Showoff then made the tag, and The World’s Largest Athlete went to work isolating Sheamus and taking firm control of the bout.</p><p>Sheamus somehow managed to fight back, and tagged in Del Rio just as Big Show tagged in Ziggler. With the San Antonio crowd firmly behind him, the World Champion immediately leveled The Showoff with a kick to the head before locking in the Cross Armbreaker.</p><p></p><p>Big Show broke the hold, but Sheamus caught the giant in White Noise before Del Rio nailed him with an acrobatic kick. Then, adding insult to injury, the champion hurled a bucket of water in Big Show’s face, sending a humiliated and irate giant packing from the ring and resulting in a count-out victory for Del Rio & Sheamus.</p><p>“Fiesta Del Rio” then resumed, as balloons fell from the ceiling and Del Rio and Sheamus celebrated inside the ring.</p><p>But was the water-tossing move a smart one on the part of the Mexican Superstar, or has the World Champion’s attempt to embarrass the giant worked only to enrage Big Show, perhaps putting the champion in a vicarious position when the two rivals square off with the title on the line at the Royal Rumble?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-01-18/results-26085374/page-8">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-01-18/results-26085374/page-8</a></p>
