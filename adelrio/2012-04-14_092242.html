Albert Del Rio defeated Ezekiel Jackson via submission. R.R came out to do the entrance which i thought he kind of rushed was quite annoyed as i was looking forward to that part. (I could hear the kids behind me saying what kind of car del rio would come out in which was funny) , big zeke must think he's hogan on tour doing the same poses to each side of the arena before the match.<br><br>Best pop- Orton then sheamus<br><br>Biggest heat- Del rio then henry</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/233869"></a><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/233869"></a><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/233869">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/233869</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Second Report: WWE House Show 4.13.12: Belfast, Northern Ireland</strong><br><br>Posted by Larry Csonka on 04.14.2012<br><br>There was a huge concert on in Belfast on the last night at round about the same time - MTV Titanic Sounds with acts like Olly Murs, Pixie Lott, Rizzle Kicks. I didn't expect it to fatally affect the attendance as tickets only went on sale for the festival in March while tickets for WWE have been since November. As well as this, I had extra tickets for cousins who couldn't go due to being on holiday so we put them on a website called gumtree bit like Ebay and were able to sell them in days. Up until a week before the event we were still getting texts of those interested.<br><br>However despite this, The Odyssey was packed out. For the first time in about five years of going, we got floor seats which gave us a good view of everyone. I couldn't see a single empty seat! I'm not very good at attendance estimates but looked at Wikipedia and apparently for sporting venues it can hold up to 11,000, leave some to allow for the ring and stage so at least 9,000 showed up. In an age where TV ratings and PPV buyrates are supposedly declining, WWE can still fill an arena in Northern Ireland.<br><br>We arrived in Belfast at 6:15 to allow us time to find parking spaces. We were lucky to find a side street which allowed us to park about a 20 minute walk from the arena. Walking through the city we could see that a lot of car parks were completely full because of the festival but they allowed for space in a car park near the Odyssey, with a sign saying Odyssey parking only.<br><br>It was very cool to be right beside the entrance for the house show especially since they had the new X/Tepee type which lit up different colours depending on who was coming out IE red for Kane and for each entrance unleashed some smoke.<br><br>Lilian Garica was the ring announcer for the evening and was introduced by someone from backstage, perhaps an FCW talent... She came out to her overly feminine music which was met to decent cheers apart from myself who gave her heat and heckled her with chants of "Bring Back Chimmel" and "You suck, Lilian." So much so that I almost lost my voice before the first match even took place. She did her usual its so great to be back in Belfast, IRELAND which was met with some confusion. This was a recurring theme as Cody and herself would repeat this unpopular geographical slip. With a lot of heckles correcting them that they were in Northern Ireland. After this she introduced our opening contest...<br><br>3. Alberto Del Rio over Ezekiel Jackson. Lilian introduced Alberto's personal ring announcer Ricardo which drew a lot of cheers from the older members of the crowd, boos from the younger. I think a lot of people were shocked but delighted to see Del Rio especially this early in the night. Del Rio got a mix of some cheers overshadowed by large boos while Zeke received quite a good babyface reception and had light Zeke chants. Ricardo made fun of Zeke's taunt where he flexes his muscles for quite a comic moment before being chased out of the ring by Zeke. Quite a short match where Zeke dominated before Alberto took control after Ricardo distracted Zeke and Del rio was able to grab and drop Zekes arm into the rope. Del Rio would follow up with his knees to Zeke's arm before locking in the Cross Arm Breaker to Zeke, who tapped out very quickly.<br><br>Biggest Pops:<br>Randy Orton<br>Sheamus<br>Big Show<br><br>Biggest Heat:<br>Daniel Bryan<br>Kane<br>Cody Rhodes/Del Rio</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/233975">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/233975</a><br></p>
