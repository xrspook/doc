Alberto will face none other than Randy Orton.</p><p>Booker tells Alberto to get his boots on and get those boots a-clickin’.</p><p>Booker tells Sheamus that he appreciates what he said earlier, but Sheamus is wrestling next and he will be in a knockdown, toe to toe fisticuffs with . . .</p><p>Tensai. </p><p>Matt Striker is in the locker room with Randy Orton and he mentions Randy’s two month layoff.
