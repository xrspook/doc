Three former world champions representing both Raw and SmackDown – Alberto Del Rio, Mark Henry and Christian – made shocking appearances to voice their support for the beleaguered Executive Vice President of Talent Relations and Interim General Manager of Monday Night Raw. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/2012/laurinaitis-huge-announcement-photos">PHOTOS</a>)<br><br>Following the WWE’s Board of Directors’ advocacy of Mr. Laurinaitis’ performance, David Otunga mentioned on Raw that he had a plan to make his superior not only the permanent General Manager of Raw, but SmackDown, too. “Mr. Excitement” approached the ring in Milwaukee along with his official legal counsel, and immediately took aim at the longstanding General Manager of SmackDown, Teddy Long. He noted it is his “duty to suggest to The Board that Teddy Long should be subject to scrutiny.”<br><br>Mr. Laurinaitis was quickly interrupted by Alberto Del Rio, entering in a 1985 Excalibur convertible worth more than $100,000. The Mexican Aristocrat had not been seen by the WWE Universe in nearly two months, and detailed in his native Spanish why Teddy Long should be ousted from his role.<br><br>Mark Henry, recently suspended indefinitely by the SmackDown General Manager, was next to enter the Bradley Center and The World’s Strongest Man echoed Del Rio’s sentiments. The proprietor of the Hall of Pain accused Long of being a bully, and indicated Laurinaitis has never behaved as such.<br><br>Completing Laurinaitis and Otunga’s trilogy was Christian, who has not competed in more than three months, and is still searching for “one more match” for the World Heavyweight Championship. Captain Charisma shared the sensibilities of his colleagues, and shook hands with Mr. Laurinaitis.<br><br>The entire ordeal was clearly a strategic arrangement by Otunga on behalf of his boss in order to put the wheels in motion to remove “Interim” from Mr. Laurinaitis’ title, and to have him run things on Friday nights as well. The official legal counsel then took a moment to put down his travel coffee mug, and pull out his iPhone to snap a few photos of himself, Mr. Laurinaitis, and their new cohorts. Otunga tweeted each photo (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/DavidOtunga/status/171418800997150720">No. 1</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/DavidOtunga/status/171419052508581888">No. 2</a>) moments later.<br><br>Will David Otunga’s plan play out the way he and John Laurinaitis hopes? To find out, tune in to Raw SuperShow Monday night at 9/8 CT on USA Network.<br></p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/2012/laurinaitis-huge-announcement">http://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/2012/laurinaitis-huge-announcement</a><br></p>
