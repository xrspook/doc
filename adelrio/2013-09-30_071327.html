Del Rio</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri | September 28, 2013</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Donald Boudah for sending in these results from tonight's WWE live event at the Von Braun Center Arena in Huntsville, AL:</p><p>There was a large crowd at at the Von Braun Center Arena.</p><p>There was a pre-taped promo from Alberto Del Rio, who says fans will be chanting "ADR."</p><p>Time for the main event featuring RVD vs. Alberto Del Rio for the World Heavyweight Championship. RVD gets a huge reaction! Del Rio messes with a kid ringside and rips up his sign. We get underway and it is all RVD. Del Rio keeps running out of the ring. RVD goes after and gets caught. Del Rio goes on the offensive. He hangs RVD upside, but misses and hits the post. After some offense, RVD misses Rolling Thunder and catches a back cracker. Del Rio goes for the Shining Wizard and misses. He grabs his belt and goes to leave. RVD brings him back and goes for the Frog Splash and Del Rio moves. He then hits RVD with the belt and gets DQed.</p><p>After the match, Del Rio gets a chair and RVD kicks it in his face. After a frog splash, Damien Sandow comes out, but RVD kicks him in he face and gives Sandow a frog splash. RVD's music hits and the fans go home happy.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0928/565940/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0928/565940/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SHOW RESULTS - 9/28 WWE in Huntsville, Ala.: RVD beats Del Rio, MITB cash-in tease, Ziggler vs. Big E. Street Fight, more</strong></p><p>Sep 29, 2013 - 8:23:03 PM</p><p>WWE Live show results; September 28, 2013; Huntsville, Ala.</p><p>Report by Bobby H., PWTorch correspondent</p><p>I bought tickets at the last minute, not knowing anything about the billing. I discovered that this was definitely the "B-Show" for the day, not that there were no stars. The crowd was enthusiastic. The arena was about 65 percent full.</p><p>The Main Event was Alberto Del Rio vs. Rob Van Dam for the World Title. Before entering the ring, Del Rio tore up a young boy's "RVD" sign at ringside, to the visible distress of the kid. Shortly after the match started, RVD left the ring to high-five the boy, which helped the kid's mood greatly. RVD was the star of the night, by far. Of note, he was wearing a singlet with "I'm Over" airbrushed on the lower back. Del Rio got nowhere with the crowd with his mock A-D-R shoulder-pointing, to his anger and dismay.</p><p>(7) Rob Van Dam beat World Hvt. champion Alberto Del Rio via DQ; Del Rio retained the World Title. At the end of the match, Del Rio hit RVD with the Heavyweight belt and got DQ'd, which threatened to bring the night to an anticlimactic end. However, RVD recovered and hit Del Rio with a throat-kick, followed by the Five-Star Frogsplash.</p><p>It got better, as Sandow then ran in with the MITB briefcase. As he approached the laid-out Del Rio, he got his own throat-kick and Five-Star Frogsplash from RVD. The crowd erupted and that was it for the evening, except for RVD celebrating with the crowd ringside and along and around the entrance ramp.</p><p>It was a B-Show total talent-wise, and no "jump out of your seat" moments, but enjoyable.</p><p>Biggest Pops: RVD, PTPs, Great Khali.</p><p>Biggest Heat: Vickie, Sandow, Del Rio.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_73622.shtml#.UklsEH_ceLs">http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article<em>73622.shtml#.UklsEH</em>ceLs</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
