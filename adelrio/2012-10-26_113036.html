Kofi with a rollup for a near fall and then he clothesline Del Rio over the top rope to the floor. Kofi teases a dive to the floor but he bounces off the ropes when Del Rio moves away from the ring.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Del Rio with an arm bar and he has his knee in Kofi’s back. We see footage during the commercial when Del Rio hit a step up enzuigiri to the shoulder that sent him to the floor. Del Rio with kicks to the arm and then Del Rio with a kick to the leg followed by punches. The referee warns Del Rio and he misses a charge into the corner and he hits the ring post with his shoulder. Kofi goes to the apron and hits a springboard cross body for a near fall.</p><p>Kofi with chops to Del Rio followed by a drop kick and a Superman punch. Kofi sets for a Boom drop and he hits it. Kofi sets for Trouble in Paradise but Del Rio ducks out of the way and then he hits a single arm breaker and gets a near fall. Kofi with a pendulum kick to a charging Del Rio and then he gets on Del Rio’s shoulders and Del Rio drops down but Kofi reverses and Del Rio saves himself by grabbing the rope.</p><p>Del Rio drops Kofi’s arm on the top rope and then Del Rio with the float over into the cross arm breaker and Kofi taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>We almost saw our second WWE Champion crowned in the first half hour when Alberto Del Rio tried to take advantage of Miz’s post match attack on Rey. However, by the time that Del Rio got to the ring and was ready to cash in the briefcase, Rey had recovered and hit a dive onto Del Rio and Alberto had second thoughts about whether he wanted to be the first man to fail when cashing in the briefcase.</p><p>The Del Rio attempt to cash in was not the final time that the WWE Title would be defended on this week’s show because Triple H announced during his State of WWE (Raw Edition) Address that Rey Mysterio would defend against John Cena since Cena never got his rematch.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=60180">http://pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=60180</a></p>
