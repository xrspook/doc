If I need to explain why I am blogging, well it's your first time on the site.</p><p>Here comes JR. Crap, that is a bit early. He is joining the on commentary. I hope that means all night long. ... Out comes Rey Rey. He will be part of a six man, with Sin Cara and Sheamus, vs. Chris Jericho, Dolph Ziggler and Alberto. It's strange bedfellows time. ... JR already makes the commentary better. Cole even pretty much said so by putting him over. ... My wife just said, "Why are Jericho and Ziggler teaming together". She didn't but the "WWE makes for strange bedfellows" explanation, and either do I. ... The crowd is live and this match. ... Wow, Ziggler made sense of this, nailing Jericho leading to Sheamus winning with the Brogue Kick. The faces win. ... Wow they both look small next to the World Champ. ... Cole just thanked JR, after putting him over, I hope this doesn't make for a bad night for Ross. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=70453&p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=70453&p=1</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Click HERE to Join 411’s LIVE WWE Raw Coverage!</strong></p><p>Posted by Larry Csonka on 07.23.2012</p><p>Jim Ross now makes his way out to join the commentary team.
