WWE gives fans a night to remember</p><p>Del Rio took the sign away and taunted him with it, seeing if Zack could take it back.</p><p>“They were in each other’s face,” said Zack’s mother Lisa. “They were nose to nose.”</p><p>“He saw it and ripped it up,” Zack said.</p><p>Zack, a St. Clair College student, has been a wrestling fan for as long as he can remember. His first experience of live WWE wrestling was a thrill. His uncle bought him the ticket as a high school graduation gift and the whole family tagged along.</p><p>Even his mother got in the action.</p><p>“(Del Rio) said ‘Mom’s playing too?’ and I said ‘You better believe it,” Lisa added.</p><p>A crowd of 3,500 diehard wrestling fans shouted, booed and cheered on their favourite wrestlers. The event also included Fandango, Big E Langston, R-Truth, Ryback, Damien Sandow, Tons of Funk, Prime Time Players, Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal from Three Man Band Xavier.</p><p>Zack’s little brother, Michael, 13, held a sign that said “I have the Rock’s cookbook.” He too got the attention of one of the wrestlers.</p><p>“After Ryback’s match, (Ryback) turned to me and I could read his lips, he said ‘He doesn’t give good recipes,’” Michael said.</p><p>Tyler Robinet, 8, had been counting down the days to the event.</p><p>“I was counting 37 days till there was one day left,” he said.</p><p>With less than 20 minutes before it started, Tyler was bouncing in his seat ready to cheer on Ryback, Daniel Bryan and Dolph Ziggler. His grandfather, Dan Duguay, sat at his side with a huge grin, happy he got Tyler into wrestling at a young age. Duguay became a big fan of wrestling during the days of Bobo Brazil and the Sheik.</p><p>“We do a lot of things together,” Duguay said. They attended the WWE event in London last year as well.</p><p>The Jamieson family bought tickets the moment they went on sale. A family full of wrestling fans, they were happy Windsor host the event – the family’s third live WWE show. Joshua Jamieson, 11, a CM Punk fan, was excited to see Daniel Bryan. His little brother, Nicholas Jamieson, 7, was looking forward to Bray Wyatt.</p><p>“It was a good event and a good crowd,” said Jason Toner, general manager of events at Global Spectrum, the company that manages the WFCU Centre. “They’re diehard fans. There were people lined up at noon even though they knew where their seats were.”</p><p>Global Spectrum has been trying to get the WWE to the WFCU Centre since it opened up, said Toner. Because WWE is “high in demand,” he plans on bringing it back for a second time.</p><p>“There are bigger things to come,” Toner said. “You will see this continue to grow. We’re already in talk for future shows.”</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2013/09/08/wwe-gives-fan-a-night-to-remember/">http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2013/09/08/wwe-gives-fan-a-night-to-remember/</a></p></p><p>WWE superstar Alberto Del Rio holds up his championship belt before taking the ring at the WFCU Centre’s WWE event Saturday, Sept. 7, 2013.
