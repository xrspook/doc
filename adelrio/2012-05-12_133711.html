Orton and Sheamus trade angry tags to start against Jericho, teasing the dissension already. Del Rio tags in and goes right to working on Orton's arm. Randy shoves him off and tags Sheamus back in, who delivers a rolling senton to Alberto before being low-bridged out of the ring by Jericho on the apron. Jericho tags in and works a loose Fujiwara armbar on Sheamus. Sheamus breaks it up and tags Orton back in. Powerslam from Orton on Jericho and he follows it with the second-rope DDT. You know what's coming next. Jericho shoves off the RKO attempt only to turn around into a dropkick from Orton though. Del Rio and Sheamus hop in now to join the action as well and barely two seconds pass before the ref is already calling for the bell to throw out the match at 5:18. Are you kidding me? Since when did referees throw out tag matches because all four men were in the ring for a whopping 5-10 seconds? That has to be the cheapest cheap finish in the history of cheap finishes, I have never in my life seen a referee throw a match out because all four men were in the ring for barely FIVE SECONDS. To call that a stupid and insulting finish would be an understatement, which is a shame because the match was going along quite nicely until that monumentally dumb ending. *3/4<br><br><br>After the match all four men continue brawling into the commercial break. When we return Cole informs us that Sheamus will take on Chris Jericho and Orton will take on Del Rio later tonight. That almost makes up for the finish to that tag match.<br><br>Randy Orton (30-10-1) vs. Alberto Del Rio (11-9)<br><br>Orton takes it right to Del Rio from the bell, catapulting him throat-first into the bottom rope. Del Rio goes for the armwork again, bodyslamming Orton to the mat with his arm trapped behind him. Del Rio blocks the second-rope DDT and hits a nice step-up enziguri on Orton for a two count. Orton responds with the over-the-shoulder backbreaker but Del Rio counters with a vicious armbreaker. Orton blocks the cross-armbar attempt and then DDTs Del Rio from the second rope in the corner. Orton sets up for the RKO but Ricardo Rodriguez leaps into the ring to interfere and gets RKO-ed in mid-air, which still somehow calls for the DQ at 5:18. Definitely the best match of the night so far up until the non-finish, but this time you expected it and it really doesn't particularly hurt either man so I'm okay with it. **<br><br>Sheamus (32-15-1) vs Chris Jericho (2-0)<br><br>Main event time though we've only got less than ten minutes left in TV time and you know damn well this isn't going to finish clean so I'm not expecting much. Booker tries to claim Jericho's return has been a huge success, despite him thoroughly and cleanly losing every feud and big match he's been involved in since that return. Sheamus uses his power early, getting Jericho tied up in the ropes and laying in the ten hammer-fists before bouncing Jericho off the mat and into the barricade as we take our last commercial break. When we return Sheamus hits a slingshot shoulder-block on Jericho for a two count. Jericho targets the injured shoulder of Sheamus and then dropkicks him off of the apron to the floor. Back inside Jericho hits another dropkick then lands on his feet in a Lionsault attempt. Sheamus hits him with a running knee but then gets caught in the Walls of Jericho but he gets the rope break eventually and then back-drops Jericho out of the ring. Del Rio runs out and tosses Jericho into the steps for the DQ finish though at 5:45 (shown). About as good as the Del Rio/Orton match from earlier, though the commercial break hurt it's flow a bit. Another cheap finish, but again, this one was atleast expected. **<br><br>After the match all four men involved in the fatal fourway hit the ring, where the faces give Del Rio their finishers while Jericho sneaks off as we go off the air.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/237858"></a><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/237858">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/237858</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's Instant Analysis 05.11.12: WWE SmackDown<br></strong><br>Posted by Michael Ornelas on 05.11.2012 <br><br>SEGMENT ONE: Sheamus & Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio & Chris Jericho<br><br>Between last week's SmackDown and this week's Raw, WWE has been giving us some pretty awesome TV tag matches. They don't involve any actual tag teams…but that's an issue for another column. This match unfortunately did not do what any match involving four competitors booked in a Fatal 4way should do – play on the distrust the partners have with one another. With the recent RKO to Sheamus on Raw, I really wanted to see tension between the babyfaces and we got none of that. The match itself was pretty solid, but I think this was booked incorrectly. After the match was thrown out, they announced that there will be two singles matches between all the competitors, but again they're both face vs. heel, and I'd love a tease at face Orton vs. face Sheamus. Maybe next week.<br><br>Match Result: Sheamus & Randy Orton beat Alberto Del Rio & Chris Jericho via disqualification<br>Match Length: Five minutes<br>Rating: 4.5 out of 10<br><br>SEGMENT SIX: Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio<br><br>Del Rio can tear apart an arm like very few others can. This match was built on destroying Orton's left arm. Orton's really just a well-rounded, top-notch Superstar these days as he sold the arm appropriately throughout the entire match. Ricardo Rodriguez was helping Del Rio work over Orton when the ref wasn't looking, so his receipt of an RKO off the top was a great payoff to that. The post-match destruction of the arm was done well, and the need for two refs to try to pry Del Rio off of Orton really sold the damage done. I think that having two matches in this storyline end in disqualification tonight alone is a problem, but as a stand-alone segment, this was pretty good.<br><br>Match Result: Randy Orton beat Alberto Del Rio via disqualification<br>Match Length: Five minutes<br>Rating: 6.5 out of 10<br><br>SEGMENT ELEVEN: Sheamus vs. Chris Jericho<br><br>This match is appropriately main-evented the show as it both got the most time of any match on the show AND has historical significance as these are the two men who fought it out at the end of this year's Royal Rumble match. Jericho targeted the hurt shoulder of the champ and brought it to him in really aggressive fashion. I'd love a longer encounter between these two, or even an extended feud. I think it's stupid that for the third time tonight, we saw a DQ ending, but we finally had all the participants in the Fatal 4way match giving off the "every man for himself" vibe (after Jericho hit the Codebreaker on Del Rio and the Sheamus/Orton face-off).<br><br>Match Result: Sheamus beat Chris Jericho via disqualification<br>Match Length: Six minutes<br>Rating: 5.0 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/237904">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/237904</a> <br><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/237858"> </a></p>
