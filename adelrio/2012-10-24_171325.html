AND SOME FAILED; A SUPERSTARS FEUD MOVES TO RAW; SWEET CHIN MUSIC GOES COUNTRY; SMACKDOWN WRESTLERS LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT THEY WILL WIN THE ROYAL RUMBLE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-01-10 23:08:40</p><p>We are live from Nashville, Tennessee and your announcers are Michael ‘Volunteer’ Cole and Jerry ‘Fang Fingers’ Lawler.</p><p><strong>Match Number One (let’s try this again): R Truth versus Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez</strong></p><p>Del Rio avoids a charge by Truth but Truth with punches and a clothesline into the corner. Truth climbs the turnbuckles and punches Del Rio but Del Rio with a reverse atomic drop and Irish whip followed by a lungblower for a near fall. Del Rio punches Truth but Truth with a head scissors and clothesline. Truth with another clothesline that sends both of them over the top rope to the floor. They fight on the floor and Rodriguez distracts Truth long enough to take a punch and enable Del Rio to get in the ring before the ten count. Truth cannot beat the count.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio by count out</p><p>After the match, Alberto gets on the mic and he says that is another victory for him, but everyone already knows that. Alberto says that it is his destiny to win the Royal Rumble and headline Wrestlemania.</p><p>Tonight, Alberto mentions that we are in Nashville, and he calls it ‘The Music City’. He calls everyone silly Americanos because they know nothing about music or culture. You only know about your Justin Biebers, American Idol, hip hop, and the boring country music. Alberto says that in Mexico, they know about music. They know about culture. He wants to show everyone real music, the mariachis. He tells Ricardo to sing for him. Ricardo sings, but he sounds like a male Jillian Hall.</p><p>Shawn Michaels’ music plays and he comes out to the ring and he addresses the WWE Universe, but before he can speak, he is interrupted by Alberto Del Rio. He reminds us who he is (because he has already been on the show). Alberto points out that Shawn is the Heartbreak Kid and a legend. He is the icon, the Showstopper. Alberto says that the people used to cheer Shawn, but now the people cheer him. They know that Alberto is the present and the future of the WWE. Shawn is just history. Alberto tells Shawn that after he wins the Royal Rumble, he will win the World Title . . . or the WWE Title. Then he will be known as the New Mr. Wrestlemania. Alberto starts to laugh but the smile is wiped off his face with some Sweet Chin Music.</p><p>Shawn cleans off his boot and then he struts around the ring. Shawn waves goodbye and applauds the fans before taking Alberto’s scarf and leaves the ring.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/54224/wwe-raw-report-nexus-tests-its-members-and-some-failed-a-superstars-feud-moves-to-raw-sweet-chin-music-goes-country-smackdown-wrestlers-let-everyone-know-that-they-will-win-the-royal-rumble.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/54224/wwe-raw-report-nexus-tests-its-members-and-some-failed-a-superstars-feud-moves-to-raw-sweet-chin-music-goes-country-smackdown-wrestlers-let-everyone-know-that-they-will-win-the-royal-rumble.html?p=1</a></p>
