Sin Cara</strong></p><p>Alberto Del Rio squared off with Sin Cara in WWE Main Event's second contest of the evening. With his battle against Randy Orton at Hell in a Cell only a few days away, The Mexican Aristocrat entered the Dunkin Donuts Center determined to prove his excellence inside the squared circle.</p><p>Of course, Del Rio and Sin Cara are no strangers to one another. The two Superstars competed against each another numerous times and both were wildly popular in Mexico before beginning their WWE careers. The familiarity between The Mexican Aristocrat and WWE's masked marvel was evident from the moment the opening bell sounded. Del Rio's strategy was clearly to keep Sin Cara grounded, but the quickness and agility of the highflier soon left both competitors engaged in a struggle for momentum.</p><p>A stark contrast to the preceding bout, neither Del Rio nor Sin Cara managed to dominate on offense and the WWE Universe was treated to a struggle of agility vs. resilience between two of WWE's finest instead. The Mexican Aristocrat tried everything in his power to knock Sin Cara off his game — even attempting to pull off the luchador's mask — but the momentum continued to waver back and forth.</p><p>As Sin Cara managed to build up a sound offense, he attempted to execute a move off the top rope, but Del Rio countered, seizing the opportunity to lock his opponent in the Cross Armbreaker and secure the victory.</p><p><strong>Randy Orton announces next week's featured contest on WWE Main Event</strong></p><p>Following Alberto Del Rio's impressive win, he immediately reached for a microphone to attack his Hell in a Cell opponent, Randy Orton, verbally. In lobbing insults at WWE's Apex Predator, Del Rio made mention of his vast fortune, which gained the attention of The Prime Time Players. The atmosphere was tense, but The Mexican Aristocrat reminded The Prime Time Players that he was not their enemy. As a result, Del Rio and the Prime Time Players joined forces and attacked a defenseless Sin Cara. With Rey Mysterio not in attendance, Sin Cara seemed to be at the mercy of his attackers.</p><p>As The Mexican Aristocrat and The Prime Time Players unleashed on Sin Cara, Randy Orton sprinted to the ring to assist WWE's masked marvel. Del Rio quickly made his exit, leaving Darren Young and Titus O'Neil to each fall prey to The Viper's RKO.</p><p>WWE's Apex Predator then addressed his Hell in a Cell opponent, announcing that Mysterio would be on WWE Main Event next week and that The Master of the 619, Orton and Sin Cara would battle Del Rio and The Prime Time Players in the featured contest next week!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwemainevent/2012-10-24/results-26062646/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwemainevent/2012-10-24/results-26062646/page-2</a></p>
