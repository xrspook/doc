They are joined by Alberto Del Rio who has to make his own entrance.</p><p>Alberto is the first to talk and he reminds us that he became the WWE Champion last night. He could not celebrate his victory because two people who were supposed to be fired jumped the rail, entered the cell, and attacked him. It happened because of Triple H. He says that Hunter cannot run this company. In the moment he became victorious, the cell magically got raised so John Cena and the hooligans could enter the ring. Then magically, the cell was lowered. Only one man has the power to take that position and that man is Triple H. He says that Triple H is a pig.</p><p>Christian says that it is fine that Hunter is the COO, but ever since he took the day to day operations of Raw, it has become unsafe. Christian says that he is not going to take it anymore.</p><p>Cody says that this is not a conspiracy, it is a fact that they have fallen victim to his negligent actions. Is it because of someone’s enormous ego?</p><p>Ziggler says that Hunter’s lack of any actions have gone on too long. They are going to take action into their own hands.</p><p>Jack says that thanks to Triple H, his friends and family are concerned for him whenever he steps into the ring every time he is on Raw.</p><p>Vickie gives a few excuse mes and she says that as a woman she feels especially vulnerable with Triple H in charge.</p><p>Otunga says that when he was a law student, he read about cases like this. He says that there are two options. They can work and risk their likelihood or they can band together and contemplate legal action.</p><p>The Countersuing Operating Officer comes out. Hunter wants to know what happened to the WWE? There used to be a time when men stood in the ring and fought. It didn’t matter if they got beat up, jumped, or got screwed over . . . they fought.</p><p>They didn’t stand in the ring and whine and cry like little kids. They didn’t threaten lawsuits. They fought like men. He doesn’t give a damn about Miz and Truth’s lawsuit or their lawsuit. Hunter cares that when all of them walk down to the ring to stand in the ring with Evan Bourne, Kofi Kingston, Sheamus, CM Punk, and John Cena. He doesn’t want them to whine at them, cry at them, or threaten to sue them. He wants them to stand in the ring and do what these people pay them to do. That is to shut up and fight.<br></p><p>Michael Cole talks about what Miz and R Truth did after Alberto Del Rio became a two time WWE Champion. Booker says that he has never seen WWE like this before. We go to the footage from last night’s Hell in a Cell pay per view.</p><p>Booker wants to know who raised and lowered the cage. Jim Ross wants to know how Truth and Miz avoided security. Cole introduces a video with Miz and R Truth on Youtube. They are doing this as Mike and Ronny. Miz apologizes that they had to get the lawyers involved, but they wanted their jobs back. Ron says that they had to make a statement. Mike says that they did what Triple H would have done. Mike says that they surrendered when they saw the cops get involved. Ron says that him and Mike got assaulted by the COO while handcuffed. Mike says that they have filed a wrongful termination lawsuit as well as pressing assault charges against Triple H. Mike apologizes to the WWE Universe for the WWE having a sorry excuse for a COO.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: John Cena, CM Punk, Sheamus, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne, and Mason Ryan versus Alberto Del Rio, Christian, Cody Rhodes, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger and David Otunga</strong></p><p>Cena and Christian start off and Cena with punches and a back body drop.

After a bit of an awkward silence, Triple H’s music plays and the COO makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Hunter says that we are out here for a vote of confidence so that means that everyone gets to tell him how he is doing as the boss of Raw. Hunter says that this job is a lot more difficult than he thought it would be. It was a job he did not ask for. He was given this job. Hunter says that Miz and R Truth want to say that he is a hypocrite and mad at them for doing what Hunter would have done. Hunter says that they should be apologizing to everyone for being a bunch of babies. Hunter says that he is not mad at them for what they did, but for their reaction to the punishment.</p><p>Hunter says that he is a bit ‘old school’. Hunter says that he likes seeing people beat the hell out of each other. He enjoys confrontation, the battles, and the chaos that is Monday Night Raw. Hunter says that he would bet his life that the WWE Universe enjoys it too. At the end of the day, isn’t that who we work for . . . all of them? At the end of the day, isn’t it the WWE Universe who signs our paychecks?</p><p>Hunter says that when it comes to running Monday Night Raw, it is his responsibility to make it the best possible show for all of them. He says that he does not work for the wrestlers, he works for the fans.</p><p>Hunter says that he is curious for their opinions.</p><p>Wade Barrett says that he has been nominated by the people at ringside to voice his grievances. He says that they think that Triple H has created an unsafe working environment. They came to WWE because they are competitors and they are professionals. They like to adhere to rules and regulations. They don’t like being attacked by people in parking lots. They shouldn’t be in an unsafe working environment if Hunter cannot control the wrestlers. Hunter said that he enjoys the chaos as well as placing your hands on the talent. The problems are due to Hunter and he is out of control.</p><p>Hunter introduces everyone to Wade Barrett, the man who led Nexus in an attack to try to shut this company down. Hunter says that the only reason Wade has a problem is because Wade is not causing it.</p><p>Mike Chioda says that as a WWE Official, he has never seen this much abuse taken at the hands of the superstars. They are supposed to be unbiased. How are they supposed to get respect for doing their jobs.</p><p>Hunter says that they were attacked and Hunter fired the two men who attacked them.</p><p>Mike says that those two guys made their way into the ring. Ricardo Rodriguez attacked Chad Patton and then Miz and Truth attacked him and Charles Robinson.</p><p>Beth points out that they are girls and on behalf of the Divas, all of the bedlam means that something might happen and it could be intentional.</p><p>Hunter wants to know one thing that has happened to the Divas.</p><p>Beth says that it could happen.</p><p>Jerry Lawler gets into the ring and he says that he is only speaking for himself. He says that this show is spiraling out of control. Raw has always been volatile, but it is becoming hazardous. Lawler says that it is not Hunter’s fault. It is what CM Punk says the problem is. It is someone behind the scenes trying to sabotage him. Everyone around the ring is paying the price.</p><p>Lawler says that there is someone who does not want to see Hunter run this company and it will get worse as long as Hunter is in charge.</p><p>Christian says that they want a vote of confidence right now. Christian says that they have no confidence in Hunter. The referees concur as well as the Divas.</p><p>Lawler is with everyone else. Lawler says that actions speak louder than words and Lawler says that he is reluctantly walking out.</p><p>The wrestlers walk out followed by the Divas and then the referees. More wrestlers leave. Michael Cole leaves while we have a few wrestlers standing at ringside waiting to make their decision. Eventually the Raw faces leave. Booker is the next to leave followed by Justin Roberts.</p><p>The only person left at ringside is Jim Ross after the cameramen leave. We see Hunter’s shoes as we go to a wide shot.</p><p>Jim Ross gets up and he looks at Hunter and Good Ole JR joins the exodus from the HHH Titanic.</p><p>The head rat returns to the ship as John Laurinaitis makes his way onto the stage. Laurinaitis turns around and goes to the back.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=62186">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=62186</a></p>
