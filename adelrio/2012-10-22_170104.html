Miz drilled Rey into the mat and scored a two count. Miz went for the Skull Crushing Finale but Rey rolled through, allowing Edge, who recovered after a long time on the floor, speared Miz and scored the pin.</p><p>For the second straight year, your winners, Team Smackdown!</p><p>Fun back and forth match. I really enjoyed this one a lot, especially the last few minutes. Having the guys wrestle in t-shirts was silly, but beyond that, they did a nice job with the booking, giving Reks and Jackson some strong spots before their eliminations, pushing the Mysterio-Del Rio issues, using Rey as the ultimate sympathetic underdog, positioning Edge as a strong babyface by having him save the day for the team when they were outgunned, and protecting monsters like Show and Sheamus with the only eliminations that weren't "clean." The wrestling ranged from OK to good but the overall story was very, very good.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=52096&p=3">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=52096&p=3</a></p>
