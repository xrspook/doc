Kane, More</strong></p><p>By Raj Giri March 24, 2013</p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Sherrod Jones for sending in these results from last night's WWE live event in Norfolk, VA:</p><p>There was a great crowd, the arena was almost full.</p><p>Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter cut a promo about saving America. Swagger vs. Justin Gabriel is up next. Good match, with Swagger winning via submission with the Patriot lock. After the match, Alberto Del Rio ran out and brawled with Swagger. Del Rio was going for the cross armbreaker, but Coulter was able to pull Swagger out of the ring.</p><p>World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio (w/ Ricardo Rodriguez) defeated The Big Show in a fans choice "No Disqualification" match. There was lots of action during the match. At one point, Big Show beat up Rodriguez and threw him in the steel steps. Ricardo was then helped to the back by officials. Alberto used a chair and a kendo stick on Show. Big Show countered and threw Del Rio against the steps. The finish saw Del Rio bulldog Big Show off the top rop through a table.</p><p>Overall great show.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0324/561425/wwe-live-event-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0324/561425/wwe-live-event-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Second Set of WWE House Show Results 03.23.13 - Norfolk, Virginia</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 03.24.2013</p><p>Jack Swagger defeated Justin Gabriel. Swagger and Colter came out first and got major heat. Colter cut one of his regular promos, and the crowd went crazy. He also said that Swagger should go into the audience and slap everyone in the face. Swagger was acting like he was going to do it but the ref was holding him back. Swagger won with the Patriot Lock but he wouldn't let go so Alberto Del Rio came out to make the save and the crowd loved it.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio defeated Big Show to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Ricardo was on crutches to sell his ankle injury. The fans could vote between a two out of three falls match or a no DQ match. No DQ won, When Big Show came out he got cheered, so he cut a heel promo so he could get some boos and it worked. This was a good match. They used tables, chairs, and kendo sticks. The end came when Del Rio and Show were on the top rope and Big Show crashed through the table. Del Rio covered for the win.</p><p>The Scope was pretty full, but it was not a sellout. Overall this was a pretty good show but if Smackdown comes back for another house show I won't attend it. The reason is there were no big names here. Raw has Cena, Jericho, Sheamus, Punk, Ryback, Ziggler, and the Shield. No disrespect to Del Rio but he is not a top guy; I didn't see one Del Rio t-shirt. I hope WWE does something with the Smackdown roster for these house shows soon.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/278064">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/278064</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
