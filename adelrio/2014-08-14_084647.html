As previously reported, Alberto Del Rio will be appearing at Sunday's TripleMania event.</p><p>Mysterio was reportedly looking to exit WWE once his deal was up, but reports surfaced that said since Mysterio has missed so much time during the course of his deal due to injuries, WWE took the option to freeze the deal. When Mysterio's contract date came up, he was informed that his deal was renewed through May of 2015 due to the time he missed due to injury. There were rumblings that the situation could potentially become a legal issue, but there haven't been any new reports for some time.</p><p>It should be noted that AAA will finally be debuting on US TV in October when they debut a new series on Wednesday nights on the El Rey Network. Scoring both Del Rio and Mysterio would be huge for their launch.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/331932">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/331932</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>REY MYSTERIO UPDATE, SHAUL GUERRERO TALKS ABOUT WHY SHE LEFT DEVELOPMENTAL, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ CAN'T WAIT FOR 90 DAYS TO END AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Dave Scherer on 2014-08-13 10:28:22</p><p>Carlos Gasco sent this item. ...

He has been out hurt for a long, long time. Steven Fernandes reporting. ... Ricardo Rodriguez tweeted the following:</p><p>"Pretty excited to start the Indy matches again soon and even more excited about the stuff coming after these darn 90 days are up."</p><p>"Amigos, desgraciadamente no estare con mi hermano Alberto en AAA este fin de semana en Mexico por algo en mi contrato... Pero en 90 Dias si" which translates in English to "Friends, unfortunately I will not be with my brother Alberto in AAA this weekend in Mexico because of something in my contract..
