He bragged that he's back but tonight he isn't here to talk about himself. Del Rio said that his uncle was the first Mexican in WWE and MSG and now he's the first in the WWE Hall of Fame.<br><br>He said his uncle has done movies and broken records and he's led the way for other Mexican stars. He introduced his uncle.<br><br>Mascaras thanked everyone very much. He said that he didn't know what to say to what his nephew said. He said that he paid the price and when you pay the price for what you do, you have to ask where you would be without everyone and everything. He said he gets asked about his longevity and said it was due to training, good food and a little wine here and there.<br><br>Mascaras thanked his family and his wife, saying he met an American woman in Chicago and she takes care of everything. He said he has a beautiful wife. He talked a little about touring Japan but I couldn't really hear it well. He mentioned another wife...like he has more than one. I was totally confused.<br><br>He said he's wrestled all over the world and started talking about beautiful places and beautiful restaurants. He thanked everyone and all the fans around the world. He finally thanked everyone.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=67272&amp;p=2">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=67272&p=2</a></p><blockquote><p>NoDQ.com > WWE > 2012 WWE Hall of Fame Report - March 31st<br><br>Posted by Steve Carrier on 03/31/2012 at 06:47 PM<br><br>- Alberto Del Rio comes out next to induct his uncle Mil Mascaras.
