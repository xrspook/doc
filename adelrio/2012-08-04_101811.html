However, he was given no quarter to celebrate, as he was soon interrupted by the No. 1 contender to the World Heavyweight Title, Alberto Del Rio. The Mexican Aristocrat offered his “congratulations,” stating that Booker must be looking forward to working with him once he defeats The Great White for the World Title at The Biggest Event of the Summer, SummerSlam.</p><p>After Booker took him to task for badmouthing The Celtic Warrior on Raw, World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus emerged to offer his sincere congratulations to the new GM. But, that is where the pleasantries came to a screeching halt.</p><p>Overruling Del Rio’s self-made Raw proclamation that he wouldn’t compete until his World Title Match with The Celtic Warrior at the up-coming pay-per-view, Booker informed the affluent Superstar that he would face the returning Randy Orton in the SmackDown main event.</p><p>As a furious Del Rio stormed out of the ring, the new man-in-charge turned to Sheamus in decisive fashion, announcing that the Irish Superstar would immediately compete in a match against Tensai! </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-08-03/results-26042234">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-08-03/results-26042234</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SmackDown results: With Sheamus’ help, Del Rio felt the sting of Orton’s RKO – Can you dig it, sucka!</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick August 03, 2012</p><p><strong>Randy Orton def. Alberto Del Rio by Disqualification</strong></p><p> In an explosive main event that saw Randy Orton return to SmackDown for the first time in two months, WWE’s Apex Predator would take on the No. 1 contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>Just when it looked as if The Viper might be ready to put The Mexican Aristocrat down, his opponent’s personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, interfered in the match, bringing about the disqualification.</p><p>In the post-match fury that followed, Orton repelled Del Rio’s assault, expelling his opponent from the ring in painful fashion. But the fireworks did not end there. As Del Rio was getting to his feet, The Great White emerged, wasting no time in hurling SummerSlam challenger back through the ropes to set up a thunderous RKO, courtesy of The Viper.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-08-03/results-26042234/page-7">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2012-08-03/results-26042234/page-7</a></p>
