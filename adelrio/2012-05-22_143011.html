Although I will admit to laughing pretty hard at Ricardo trying to get out of his tuxedo. We then get a promo video for the 1000th episode and the move to 3 hours. So, was the only point of this segment to pimp out the WWE Youtube channel and the move to 3 hours? Whatever. This gets a separate segment only because I didn't want to take away fro the Orton/Del Rio rating.<br><br>Rating: 2.0 out of 10<br><br>SEGMENT FOUR: Alberto Del Rio vs Randy Orton<br>Match Result: Randy Orton wins via DQ, I guess<br>Match Length: 8 minutes or so<br><br>This was your typical TV match between two main eventers – get in the small moves, fake at doing bigger moves, that sort of thing. The match ended due to Jeriference, which sets up a feud between the two. Jericho going crazy and yelling about being the Best in the World (tm) was oddly entertaining, as was him giving Orton 3 Codebreakers. Match was fine, postmatch shenanigans were even better.<br><br>Rating: 7.0 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/239206">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/239206</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's WWE RAW Report 5.21.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Tony Acero on 05.21.2012 <br><br>We're back with Ricardo Rodriguez in the ring, presumably waiting to announce Del Rio. Santino's music hits, instead, though, and he comes out with the Cobra on hand. He says that he doesn't understand Rodriguez, and he doesn't think anyone does. He says that he doesn't roll his r's and calls his eyebrows catepillars. Ricardo tries, and Santino says it sucks, then rolls some R's of his own. Ricardo and he roll em back and forth, sounding like a squealing Chewbacca. He pulls up the Cobra and Ricardo backs off. Ricardo tries to remove his jacket, but gets stuck and Santino claims he has no choice, but to hit the Cobra. He wants to now show how it's done. He requests Del Rio's music and announces him as weighing in at 108 give a craps, coming from some place in Mexico.<br><br>Before any match happens, we get a promo for RAW's 1,000th episode. More dubstep! They announce the show at being 3 hours each and every Monday...<br><br>Del Rio doesn't look too happy at Santino announcing him.<br><br>After a break, we come back to Cole and King trying to cover up the dumb mistake of Ace saying he resigned Show on Saturday, thus meaning he was a WWE Superstar and interrupting the match on Sunday would mean he'd be fired....geez, man.<br><br>Match 2: Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio<br>Lockup to start. Side headlock from Orton. Del Rio leads him into the corner. Orton is able to hit some kicks then a body slam. He drops a knee, but Del Rio is out of the way. Del Rio with a kick to the arm of Orton, then attacks the arm. His next move is deflected and Orton stomps the arm. Orton gets him in the corner and mounts for ten punches. He gets to four before Del Rio slips out onto the apron. Bad move, as Orton sets him up for the DDT. Del Rio flips him over rthe ropes though, and Orton lands on the apron. Del Rio kicks the leg then hangs up Orton as we go to break.<br><br>Back to the show and Del Rio has Orton's left arm in a hold. Orton with a headbutt or two but Del Rio uses his knees acorss the arm of Orton. He drops one more knee on his head then pins for 1....22...NO! An armbar from Del Rio, but Orton gets out. Del Rio fights back with a kick to the arm. Del Rio hits the ropes then flies across the ring. Orton ducks out of the way, sending Orton to the outside. Orton hits a clotheslines, one more. Powerslam from Orton. Orton sends Del Rio to the ropes and hits the rope-assisted DDT. He's looking for the RKO. Here's Jericho! Codebreaker to Randy Orton!<br>Winner: Randy Orton via DQ (**)<br><br>Jericho grabs the mic. He is the best in the world at what he does. He repeats this, louder. One more time! The best at EVERYTHING he does! Orton stands, so Jericho hits another Codebreaker, a bit more sloppily. Jericho looks to leave the ring then reconsiders. He lifts Orton by head head, nose to nose with Orton, then hits one more, better looking Codebreaker. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/239200">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/239200</a> <br></p>
