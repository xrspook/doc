He revealed a different side of himself to the students, joining them in the audience and explaining how he became successful.<br><br>“It’s being tolerant,” he told them. “Being patient, waiting my turn. They should change my moniker from The World’s Strongest Man to The World’s Most Tolerant Man.”<br><br>He went on to stress the importance of acceptance. “I hope that every one of you respects each other,” Henry added. “You have to be tolerant.”<br><br>Eve shared her own experiences with bullies in high school. “For me, bullying happened behind my back,” she said, explaining how people gossiped about her. The former two-time Divas Champion then told the students how even bystanders can help stop bullying.<br><br>“They want an audience,” Eve said. “If you don’t give that to them, you take away their power. If you’re not helping the victim, you’re helping the bully.”<br><br>Rosenberg then led the children in a be a STAR chant, and urged them to promise to be tolerant of each other and help end bullying.<br><br>To close out the rally, Principal Roshone Ault explained the resources available to students who may be facing intolerance from their peers.<br><br>“If you are being bullied, you have many individuals who are here to support you and help you work it out," she said.</p></blockquote><p>转载自：<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wwe.com/inside/overtheropes/wweinyourcorner/be-a-star-comes-to-the-bronx">http://www.wwe.com/inside/overtheropes/wweinyourcorner/be-a-star-comes-to-the-bronx</a><br></p></p><p>WWE Superstars Sheamus, Mark Henry, Eve and Alberto Del Rio lead an anti-bullying rally at the South Bronx Academy.</p><p>They are joined by Executive Vice President of Creative Stephanie McMahon, CEO of The Creative Coalition Robin Bronk, celebrity blogger Micah Jesse and Peter Rosenberg of HOT 97 FM.</p><p>The hundreds of students are excited to see The World's Strongest Man and give him a standing ovation.</p><p>Sheamus shares his experiences of being bullied with the children.</p><p>“It’s gotten worse in this day and age," Sheamus said.
