AND THEN PROBABLY CHANGE HIS MIND; NUMBER ONE CONTENDERS FOR THE TAG TITLES DETERMINED AGAIN</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-09-07 22:00:39</p><p>We begin this week’s show with a look at the sacrifice that Ricardo Rodriguez made for Alberto Del Rio by sticking his face in the way of a Brogue Kick from Sheamus. It is time for David Otunga’s Tout that this will be dealt with on Smackdown.</p><p>We are outside Booker T’s office and the door opens. We see Alberto Del Rio and David Otunga help Ricardo Rodriguez. Rodriguez has a neck brace and Otunga has his travel mug. Ricardo is still in pain and they walk away.</p><p>We are live on tape from Moline, Illinois and your announcers are Michael ‘Why won’t anyone hug me’ Cole and Josh ‘Is there a lawyer on the roster who will take my case’ Mathews.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio makes his way to the ring along with Ricardo Rodriguez and David Otunga.</p><p>They make their way to the ring at a gingerly pace because of Ricardo’s injury.</p><p>Ricardo finally makes his way into the ring and Otunga consoles him.</p><p>Alberto says that he is on the greatest roll of his career. Two weeks ago, he made Randy Orton tap out. Last week, he defeated the red, big monster Kane. On Raw, he destroyed John Cena in a Falls Count Anywhere Match. In two weeks, he will face Sheamus for the World Title. That will be at Night of Champions. To be honest, he is not happy. He is not completely happy.</p><p>If that match against Sheamus was about skills and brains, he would be the winner. Sheamus has an advantage because Sheamus can use something so dangerous. More dangerous than a steel chair. It is something that should be illegal. Alberto says that he is talking about the Brogue Kick.</p><p>Alberto says that it is brutal and barbaric and should be banned. Alberto cannot believe that people think that the move should be allowed. Alberto says kicking someone in the head is a criminal act.</p><p>Ricardo is not only his personal ring announcer, he is his friend. Ricardo is his only friend. Now his friend may have permanent physical and moral damage. Alberto says that there are more who have suffered the Brogue Kick. Alberto says the Cross Arm Breaker is different. It is pure. The Brogue Kick is a criminal act.</p><p>Otunga introduces himself and he takes a sip from the Super Sized Travel Mug. He says that Ricardo has hired him because what happened to him was no accident. Sheamus’ actions were malicious and calculated to cause bodily harm on an innocent person.</p><p>David has a video package showing the devastating effect of the Brogue Kick.</p><p>David says that was difficult to watch. If WWE continues to turn a blind eye and continue to allow Sheamus to use the Brogue Kick, it is a joke. They met with Booker T and they demanded compensation and justice. David says that he will make sure that his client’s pain and suffering will not be in vain.</p><p>Booker T’s music interrupts David and he comes to the stage and he wags his finger at David, Alberto, and Ricardo.</p><p>Booker wants to know if they are kidding him. Booker says that what they were talking about was supposed to be confidential. The first thing that David wants to do is run his mouth and bring his case to the people.</p><p>Booker says that if David wants to do that, they should do that. Booker asks everyone if he should ban the Brogue Kick. Booker wants to make sure that he did not mishear the chants of ‘no’. Booker says that the Brogue Kick is still legal.</p><p>Booker wants to know if suckas want to dig.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio drives into the arena and he makes his way to the announce table to join Josh and Michael.</p><p>Match Number Six: Sheamus versus David Otung in a Non Title Match</p><p>They lock up and Sheamus with a clean break. Otunga with a kick and punches to Sheamus. Sheamus with a knee and kick to Otunga. Otunga tries for a hip toss but Sheamus with a short arm clothesline. Sheamus tries for the Brogue Kick but Otunga moves and Sheamus crotches himself. Otunga with an elbow and kick to send Sheamus to the floor. Otunga rolls Sheamus back into the ring and gets a near fall.</p><p>Otunga with punches to Sheamus followed by a running clothesline into the corner and a shoulder tackle for a near fall. Otunga with a reverse chin lock. Sheamus with a clothesline followed by a running shoulder into the corner and a running knee lift. Otunga goes to the apron and Sheamus with the forearms across the chest.</p><p>Sheamus with White Noise and then he sets for the Brogue Kick.</p><p>Booker comes out and he apologizes for interrupting Sheamus’ match. Booker says that he has had a change of heart and he is banning the Brogue Kick.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio smiles and Booker tells Sheamus to carry on. Sheamus thinks about what else he can do to beat Otunga. Alberto leaves ringside while Otunga is still down.</p><p>Otunga punches Sheamus but Sheamus hits a uranage back breaker and then he applies the Cloverleaf and Otunga taps out.</p><p>Winner: Sheamus</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/71752/wwe-smackdown-report-the-barrage-is-back-booker-t-shows-that-he-will-make-a-decision-and-stick-to-it-and-then-probably-change-his-mind-number-one-contenders-for-the-tag-titles-determined-again.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/71752/wwe-smackdown-report-the-barrage-is-back-booker-t-shows-that-he-will-make-a-decision-and-stick-to-it-and-then-probably-change-his-mind-number-one-contenders-for-the-tag-titles-determined-again.html?p=1</a></p>
