Participants were 3MB, Alex Riley, Justin Gabriel, Tyson Kidd, Primo, Epico, Michael McGillicutty, Ted DiBiase and Alberto Del Rio.

Participants to my memory were: Jinder Mahal, Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre, Tyson Kidd, Justin Gabriel, Fandango, Michael McGillicutty, Primo, Epico, Alex Riley, and Alberto Del Rio. I brought one of two signs that night and found out Chicago hates 3MB but they appreciated my "3MB Brand Air Guitar Picks" sign and so did the three of them. McGillicutty gave me flack for the sign. It came down to Heath Slater and Del Rio.</p><p>Winner: Del Rio</p><p>Triple threat match for the Intercontinental was up. Wade Barrett, Kofi Kingston and Alberto Del Rio with Ricardo ringside. Sorry to go off on a tangent but this was the highlight of my evening with my second sign being noticed. I'm guessing since it was a house show they were lenient on the PG rating. I would like you remind you this was a bet that I wouldn't make it and bring it to the show by my best friend. I am a solid Wade Barrett fan and since the poor guy has fans few and far between I held it up with pride as I wore my Barrett Barrage shirt. I will share what it was since Wade stopped to read it and then proceeded to get wide eyed and be rendered speechless. The sign said "All I want for Christmas is a taste of England", take it as you will. Wade ended up being the ping pong in this match having Kofi and Del Rio provide a majority of the offense throughout the match. Del Rio locked the armbar in twice, once on the canvas and once on the ropes to Barrett. When Wade would try for the finisher Kofi would counter with the Trouble in Paradise. Kofi got the pin on Wade.</p><p>Winner: Kofi Kingston</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1227/559042/wwe-live-event-results-chicago/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1227/559042/wwe-live-event-results-chicago/</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2012-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2012</a></p>
