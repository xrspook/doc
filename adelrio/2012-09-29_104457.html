                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2012-09-28 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2012-09-29 10:44:57+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2012, smackdown, ricardo_rodriguez, randy_orton, big_show, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: SHEAMUS HAS A NUMBER ONE CONTENDER; WHO GETS FED TO RYBACK THIS WEEK?; A TAG TEAM TOURNAMENT; WELCOME HOME BETH PHOENIX; HOW WILL ANTONIO CESARO DO WITHOUT AKSANA?</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-09-28 21:59:56</p><p>We begin this week’s show with a look at the trials and tribulations of Daniel Bryan and ane as they declared they was the Tag Team Champions and cost each other singles matches. (Never mind the fact that they were on the same page when they went chair crazy at the end of the show)</p><p>We are live on tape from Buffalo, New York and your announcers are Michael ‘Probation is over’ Cole and Josh ‘Glad I am not in a tag team’ Mathews.</p><p>Big Show makes his way to the ring and he has something to say even though he is ready to wrestle. We see footage from Big Show’s return on Monday evening when he took care of Brodus Clay and Tensai.</p><p>Show says that the most dominant and destructive force in WWE history is back and he wants the World Championship. His last title reign lasted forty-five seconds. Show asks everyone if they know what that does to the psyche of someone like him. Then he watched the guy who took his title go to the main event of Wrestlemania and lose it to Sheamus in eighteen seconds.</p><p>That was a turning point in his career. Show was not in the main event of Wrestlemania, he was not the World Champion, and he was in a match where he was made subject to ridicule. No one will make fun of him when he becomes the World Champion again.</p><p>He knows that those are lofty goals, but he is the one man on the roster who can defeat the current World Champion. He says that he will . . .</p><p>We will never find out how Big Show will beat Sheamus because Randy Orton makes his way to the ring.</p><p>Randy tells Show that he finds it funny that Big Show is talking about how he will take out Sheamus when he hasn’t even faced the most sadistic person on Smackdown. Randy says that their match is for the Number One Contender spot and the winner faces Sheamus at Hell in a Cell. Orton reminds Show that he is a nine time World Champion and if Show thinks that he will stand between him and his chance at number ten, Show will not be standing much longer.</p><p>Show tells Randy that it looks like someone will get bit by an RKO or hit with a KO.</p><p>They stare down each other . . .</p><p>Until Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and he emerges from the back with Ricardo Rodriguez. Alberto says that you cannot toss Del Rio just like that. Booker T cheated him when he reinstated the Brogue Kick at Night of Champions. Alberto says that he is better than both of them together.</p><p>Del Rio says that both of you dogs go to the back of the line. Del Rio enters the ring and Orton with an RKO. Orton stares down Show before leaving the ring and he goes to the back.</p><p>Randy Orton walks in the back as we go to commercial, but before we get to the commercial, Alberto Del Rio assaults Orton in the back and he pushes a case against Orton. Orton holds his wrist as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and we see footage of Alberto Del Rio’s attack on Randy Orton with a focus on the left arm.</p><p>Randy Orton’s music plays and Alberto Del Rio comes out to the stage. Alberto says that it looks like Randy Orton will not be able to compete tonight. The people will be happy to know that the one who will be taking Randy’s place is none other than him . . . Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>Randy Orton attacks Del Rio from behind and he sends Del Rio into the giant W on the stage. Orton holds his ribs and he gingerly makes his way to the ring.</p><p><strong>Match Number Seven: Big Show versus Randy Orton in a Number One Contender Match</strong></p><p>Orton tries to stay close to the ropes while Show misses a punch and Orton gets out of the way. Show asks Orton about his ribs. Show backs Orton into the corner and he sets for the chop but Orton with punches. Show with a head butt and Orton goes to the mat. Orton struggles to get back to his feet and Show tries for the Shhhh chop but Orton with a punch.</p><p>Show with another head butt to send Orton to the mat. Show with a claw on the ribs and then Show yells at the referee. Show tells Orton he shouldn’t have come out. Show with a punch to the ribs and then he says this is the reason why he is the only one who can be World Champion.</p><p>Show stands on the midsection and Orton grimaces as he struggles to breathe. Show returns to the stomach claw. Orton struggles to get back to his feet and Show with a head butt and inverted face lock into an elbow drop for a near fall.</p><p>Orton rolls to the floor and Show follows after him. Orton with kicks to the midsection but Show with a punch to the ribs. Show hot shots Orton’s ribs on the ringside barrier and we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Orton is trying to get back to his feet in the corner. Show with an Irish whip but he runs into a boot from Orton. Orton with punches but Show grabs Orton by the throat. Orton counters the choke slam with a DDT and both men are down. Orton crawls and gets a near fall but Show with a powerful kick out.</p><p>Orton with the Garvin Stomp to Show followed by a knee drop to the head. Show with punches to the ribs and he backs Orton into the corner. Show with more punches and he tells Orton he wants him to quit. Orton pushes Show away but Show with more punches. Show returns to the stomach claw.</p><p>Show walks across Orton’s chest. Show with another punch to the ribs and Orton rolls to the floor. Show wants to send Orton into the ring post but Orton gets to his feet and he sends Show into the ring post. Orton rolls into the ring and Show takes his time getting into the ring. Orton with a boot to Show on the apron and Orton tries for a super IEDDT but Show is able to fight him off and he drops Orton’s arm and ribs across the top rope.</p><p>Show signals for the choke slam and he picks Orton up but Ortron with an RKO for a near fall. Orton gets to his feet first and then he backs up and it is time to go from thirty-five but Show is able to get up and he grabs Orton by the throat and he hits a choke slam but Orton kicks out at two.</p><p>Show with a second choke slam but this was more devastating and he gets the three count.</p><p>Winner: Big Show</p><p>After the match, Show returns to the ring and he sets for the knockout punch. Orton turns around and Show connects to the jaw and Orton falls to the mat.</p><p>Show takes the mic and he tells Sheamus that he will see him at Hell in a Cell.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/72277/wwe-smackdown-report-sheamus-has-a-number-one-contender-who-gets-fed-to-ryback-this-week-a-tag-team-tournament-welcome-home-beth-phoenix-how-will-antonio-cesaro-do-without-aksana.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/72277/wwe-smackdown-report-sheamus-has-a-number-one-contender-who-gets-fed-to-ryback-this-week-a-tag-team-tournament-welcome-home-beth-phoenix-how-will-antonio-cesaro-do-without-aksana.html?p=1</a></p>
