Will we ever see the Dead Man again? A door opens . . .</p><p>We are live on tape from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and your announcers are Matt ‘Shotz Brewery’ Striker, Todd ‘Schlemiel’ Grisham, and Michael ‘The Bud Selig of announcers’ Cole.</p><p>Kane and Paul Bearer are at the gravesite for the Undertaker and Kane says that the saga is over. He has proven his dominance over the Undertaker for the final time. He says that his brother is never coming back. It is because he buried Taker. Kane starts to walk to the ring and he says that there is going to be talk in the coming days and months about plots and conspiracy theories. The Undertaker is gone because of one person and one person only. That person is him.</p><p>Now that his brother is truly one with the dark side. Now that he is condemned to an eternity of agony, he wants everyone to thank him. He wants everyone to thank him for removing the false hope that he provided to each and everyone’s meaningless lives. He says that he knows that everyone is clinging to a futile shred of hope that the Undertaker will return. He says that will never happen. The Dead Man is six feet underground. While he is rotting and decomposing, like his legacy, Kane says that he is the champion.</p><p>Kane says that he is the pulse of everyone. He is the heartbeat of every insect in the audience desperate for a patriarch. He says that he is the devil’s favorite demon. Kane says that the time for mourning is now so he demands that everyone stand up and bow your heads to observe a moment of silence for the man you will never see again. His fallen and so to be forever forgotten brother, the Undertaker.</p><p>The moment of silence is interrupted by Alberto Del Rio, who drives into the arena. Kane cannot believe what Alberto did and he talks to Paul about it.</p><p>Alberto says that this is a tragedy and he is not talking about the Undertaker. The only tragedy is that he never had a chance at the World Title. He tells Kane that he is handsome, rich, and powerful. He says that the only funeral we are going to have is for the World Title.</p><p>Kane wants to know if Alberto is out of his mind for interrupting this ceremony. He says that the last thin that Alberto should be worried about is the title.</p><p>Alberto knocks the urn out of Paul Bearer’s hands and then Kane tries to punch Del Rio but Alberto ducks him and then Alberto hits a step up enzuigiri that sends Kane into the already dead flowers.</p><p>Rey Mysterio comes out and he trips Del Rio, sending Alberto into the ropes. Before Rey can hit the 619, Alberto goes to the floor. Paul Bearer is in the ropes doing something and Rey sees this as an opportunity to give Paul a 619. Kane kicks Rey off the apron to the floor.</p><p>Edge comes to the ring and he gives Kane a spear.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Alberto Del Rio is in the back with Teddy Long and Teddy wants Alberto to speak in English. Alberto demands a World Title match tonight. Teddy refuses to give him the match. Alberto then demands to be named the number one contender because there is no one better than him. Teddy says that there are two men who would disagree with Alberto.</p><p>Teddy tells Alberto that tonight there is going to be a match to determine the number one contender for the World Title at Survivor Series. Alberto will be in the match, but he will be facing Edge and Rey Mysterio. Teddy tells Alberto to prove that he is the top commodity on Smackdown. Alberto says that he will prove it.</p><p>We are back with a look back at the funeral for the Undertaker that saw appearances from Alberto Del Rio, Rey Mysterio, and Edge; but none of them were out to pay their last respects to Undertaker.</p><p><strong>Match Number Five: Alberto Del Rio versus Rey Mysterio versus Edge in a Number One Contender Match</strong></p><p>The bell rings and Rey goes after Del Rio while Edge watches.
