Sheamus was asked about Ziggler winning but Sheamus said he wanted to focus on tonight. He said Alberto Del Rio was a desperate man given all the things he's pulled recently. He said his father used to tell him that you could judge a man by the car he drives. Sheamus said that he has the only hood ornament he needs with the World title. He promised to take out Del Rio.</p><p>They introduced The Miz, who was returning from filming The Marine: Homefront. The crowd chanted "Miz is awesome." He said that he bet everyone was wondering where he was. He said he was filming a movie and was a bonafide movie star. He said that he was treated like a superstar for the first time in a long time. He said that he won MITB in the past and cashed him and that's why he is here today. He announced he was putting himself into the WWE championship Money in the Bank match. He said he was tired over being overlooked. Good promo.</p><p>Mick Foley's favorite Raw moment was winning the WWF title. I loved that one too. They noted that WCW gave it away and 600,000 fans immediately tuned into Raw.</p><p>World champion Sheamus vs. Alberto Del Rio</p><p>They locked up and Del Rio went to the floor when Sheamus had him on the defensive. He returned to the ring and nailed Sheamus with a right but Sheamus fired back with a number of shots in the corner.

Sheamus finally broke Dek free and charged but Del Rio avoided the charge and Sheamus nailed the ringpost with his shoulder. Del Rio continued to control Sheamus, using a headbutt to keep Sheamus down. Del Rio went for a cross armbreaker but Sheamus avoided it. </p><p>Del Rio sent Sheamus over the top to the apron.

Dolph came out with the briefcase and went to cash in.

The announcers made it clear that he didn't cash in as the bell was never sounded to kick off the match. Sheamus went to the back, celebrating with the fans. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70249/complete-wwe-money-in-the-bank-ppv-coverage-two-first-time-mitb-winners-and-more.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70249/complete-wwe-money-in-the-bank-ppv-coverage-two-first-time-mitb-winners-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>FULL MONEY IN THE BANK BLOG</strong></p><p>By Dave Scherer on 2012-07-15 20:10:33</p><p>World Title match time, Alberto vs. Sheamus. Ricardo does his thing. The fans were eh. Sheamus got into'd and got a better reaction, but not deafening. ... They told a story about Alberto tearing up some classic comic book at ComicCon last week. I am sure that means he is a heel to some people but to me, that makes him a face. I kid comic book fans. ... ADR is in control early. Interesting spot came when Sheamus tried to hit ADR with a sledge and missed and ADR didn't sell it, as he shouldn't. ... The story thus far is that ADR is working on Sheamus' injured arm. ... Sheamus started to make a comeback but he ran his shoulder into ADR. ... OK, Alberto is still dominating. This is starting to feel like Sheamus somehow wins and Ziggler comes right down to cash in MITB. ... Sheamus puts ADR over the ropes and pounds him with ten brutal shots to the chest but Sheamus did one too many and ADR hurt the arm. That didn't stop Sheamus from getting a two count with the Irish Curse. ... Sheamus missed a Brogue Kick and ADR got a two and a half. ... ADR kicked Sheamus once and then missed a kick to the back of the head, badly. Sheamus hit White Noise and, with his arm pinned to his side, set himself up for the Brogue Kick. 1-2-3. It was a good, solid, not great match. Now, will Ziggler run down? And if he does, will he lose right now because Sheamus is not out. ... Ricardo ran down and jumped on Sheamus. Before Sheamus could kill him, ADR came in and the two began beating him up as the fans chanted "We Want Ziggler". Well, they got him. Down he came with the briefcase. He went to cash it in when ADR tried to stop him. ADR ate the briefcase. Ziggler cashed in and as he turned around, Sheamus nailed him with a Brogue Kick. Cole right away made it clear that since the bell didn't ring Ziggler didn't cash in the contract, which made no sense at all to me since the intention was there. What made even less sense was that Ziggler had Sheamus vulnerable and they STILL had Ziggler get laid out. I feel for the guy, they book him like dog crap. And they wonder why guys don't get over. Sheesh.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70250/full-money-in-the-bank-blog.html?p=1">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70250/full-money-in-the-bank-blog.html?p=1</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411’s WWE Money in the Bank Report 07.15.12</strong></p><p>Posted by Scott Slimmer on 07.15.2012</p><p>Matt Striker is in the back with Sheamus. Sheamus admits that Alberto Del Rio is a vicious competitor who had to resort to slamming the hood of his car onto Sheamus' head. But Sheamus doesn't need a fancy car or an expensive hood ornament, because he has the only ornament he'll ever need – the World Heavyweight Championship. Sure, he may drive a car that will eventually end up in a scrap yard, but after tonight, Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez will be in the scrap yard as well.</p><p>We head back to the ring, and after two-and-a-half months… THE MIZ IS BACK! We get a "Miz is awesome! Miz is awesome!" chant from the crowd, and Miz asks if they missed him. He's been of filming a movie, and for the first time in a long time he got the respect he deserves. He's won Money in the Bank in the past, and he's cashed it in successfully. But now it's time for the Miz to make an impact, and that's why tonight there won't just be four former WWE Championship in Money in the Bank… there will be FIVE. Miz will prevail, and he will be the WWE Champion again. Why? Because he's the Miz, and he's a movie star, and he's AWESOME. Crowd was solidly behind Miz here.

But toned, tanned and in rare form.</p><p>While Sheamus and Del Rio was not Sheamus and Daniel Bryan, there was a heightened drama to the match which made it better than it should have been.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1258940-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2012-15-things-we-learned-from-tonights-ppv/page/8">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1258940-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2012-15-things-we-learned-from-tonights-ppv/page/8</a></p><blockquote><p>WWE Money in the Bank 2012 Results: Sheamus Defeats Alberto Del Rio</p><p>By Mike Chiari (Featured Columnist) on July 15, 2012</p><p>The match may not have received much hype heading into Money in the Bank, but that didn't seem to bother the competitors, as Sheamus and Alberto Del Rio put on a solid match before Sheamus ultimately came out on top and retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>It seems pretty clear that Sheamus' feud with Del Rio is a transitional one before he moves on to something else, and the Celtic Warrior's victory confirms that. The creative team made an effort to heat things up over the past couple of weeks, with Del Rio slamming the hood of his car onto Sheamus, but I'm not sure the fans ever got fully invested.</p><p>There has been so much time put into the WWE championship angle and the Money in the Bank ladder matches that Sheamus and Del Rio have faded into the background. The bout had to be good in order to bolster a fairly thin card, though, and both Sheamus and Del Rio answered the bell in that regard.</p><p>Sheamus has gained a great deal of popularity over the past year and continues to be booked as a dominant champion. Since winning the Royal Rumble, Sheamus has steamrolled the competition, including an 18-second win over Daniel Bryan at WrestleMania and numerous successful title defenses.</p><p>Not everyone has been particularly happy with Sheamus' title run thus far.</p><p>They believe he is too much of an unstoppable force, but there aren't any worthy challengers at this point. Sheamus has done a great job transitioning from being a heel a little over a year ago to being one of the most popular faces in the company, alongside John Cena, CM Punk and Randy Orton.</p><p>As for Del Rio, he is in a very tough spot right now.</p><p>He has been chasing the World Heavyweight Championship for quite some time, but I feel like that is only because of a lack of other options. Del Rio has technically been in the main-event scene, but he has never looked like an actual threat to take the strap away from The Great White.</p><p>Del Rio will probably have to move onto something else now, although it's tough to say what. He and Ricardo Rodriguez were engaged in a bit of a side feud with Santino, so perhaps Del Rio can commit to that fully and win the United States Championship in order to get his character back on track.</p><p>Sheamus must now deal with a new adversary as well, but it is tough to say who.</p><p>Perhaps he can rehash the short rivalry he had with Dolph Ziggler. If that doesn't work, then I could see a rejuvenated Tensai or a returning Wade Barrett challenging him.</p><p>The World Heavyweight Championship scene is in need of something different, so hopefully Sheamus' win leads to that.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1256620-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2012-results-sheamus-defeats-alberto-del-rio">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1256620-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2012-results-sheamus-defeats-alberto-del-rio</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Money in the Bank 2012 Results: Sheamus Retains the World Title</strong></p><p>By Tom Clark(Featured Columnist) on July 15, 2012</p><p>This one began with Del Rio making his usual grand entrance to a rousing ovation of hate from the crowd.</p><p>The world champion, on the other hand, received a great pop and was all business, as he power-walked down to the ring and was soon eye-to-eye with the Mexican Aristocrat.</p><p>Okay, the sides have been established. Now, time for the action.</p><p>The champ, in typical fashion, did not back down from Del Rio, who took the fight right to him. Del Rio soon began working on the left arm of Sheamus, a tactic that he has often used in recent months.</p><p>On a side note, pro wrestlers traditionally always work the left side. They may change it up from time to time, but for the most part, you will find that it is the left leg and left arm that get the most attention in a match.</p><p>I expected this match to be rough and tumble, with each man working stiff and being very physical throughout.</p><p>I was not disappointed.</p><p>Though Sheamus has received some criticism in recent months since winning the world title, mostly because he is viewed as being boring by some, I have to say that I have been very impressed with his work ethic thus far.</p><p>Sheamus is a bruiser, a guy who may smile and crack wise in his promos but who lets his fists do the talking in his matches. I believe that he has only gotten better since becoming the man on Friday Night SmackDown.</p><p>To Del Rio’s credit, though he has received a fair amount of criticism himself because fans question if he will every truly become a top guy, he definitely brought it in this match.</p><p>Going toe-to-toe against a world champion who is presented as a tough guy and a man who is very punishing in the ring is not an easy task, but make no mistake about it: Alberto Del Rio is tougher than leather.</p><p>Old school Run DMC reference in hand, I will also say that I was very impressed with this match as a whole.</p><p>I am a sucker for the classic ground-and-pound style, and that is what fans got with this one. </p><p>It is matches like this one that do nothing but give more credibility to the championship that is on the line. If fans are to accept a major title and believe that it should be held in high regard, then the men working to attain it need to give everything they have in order to get it.</p><p>It’s the only way to make the belt more relevant for fans and for the company, and to me, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship means a little more now than it did before the pay-per-view.</p><p>The fact that Sheamus retained the title does not surprise me. The fact that Dolph Ziggler attempted to cash in right away does.</p><p>Dolph has been painted as the future, a guy whose best years are ahead of him and who could carry the company forward. Yet every time he seems to get close, it never happens.</p><p>Earlier in the night, he won the SmackDown ladder match, and again, it seems as though he’s on his way now.</p><p>Then, he’s again laid out with nothing to show for it.</p><p>It’s not the end of the world, of course. Ziggler still has the briefcase, but to see him once again put down makes me seriously question just how seriously WWE is taking him.</p><p>But on this night, it’s Sheamus who walks out with the world championship.</p><p>For me, the Great White has earned it.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1259630-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2012-results-sheamus-retains-the-world-title">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1259630-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2012-results-sheamus-retains-the-world-title</a></p>
