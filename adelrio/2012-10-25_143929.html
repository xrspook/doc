Then we see Alberto Del Rio go El Kabong on the shoulder followed by the cross arm breaker.</p><p>It is time for that long time Raw regular, Ricardo Rodriguez to introduce Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>Alberto drives into the building and then he makes his way into the ring. Alberto tells us who he is, but we already know that. It does not matter to him who wins the Elimination Chamber match on Sunday for Smackdown because it is his destiny to be the World Champion at Wrestlemania.</p><p>Another Raw regular, Edge makes his way into the building. Edge asks Alberto ‘que pasa’ and then he says that he has been so busy beating Dolph Ziggler on Smackdown the last two weeks that he almost forgot that Alberto attacked him with a guitar two weeks ago on Raw. Edge says that Alberto talks about a destiny and Edge says that he has a destiny too.</p><p>Edge takes Del Rio down and he punches Del Rio. Edge takes off his jacket and then he pulls his hair as he sets for the spear. Ricardo Rodriguez runs interference on the apron and Edge punches him. Del Rio rolls to the apron and then he drops Edge’s arm on the rope. Edge spears Alberto off the apron.</p><p>Vickie Guerrero comes out and she says that on Sunday there is a World Title Match in the Elimination Chamber, but she wants to introduce the new World Heavyweight Champion, her boyfriend, Dolph Ziggler.</p><p>We go to footage from Smackdown last week and we see Edge hitting a spear while Vickie was recovering from her failed spear attempt on Edge.</p><p>Vickie reminds Edge that she told him over and over and over and over again that if he uses the spear, he will face the consequences. On Friday night, there will be the official coronation of Dolph Ziggler as the new World Champion.</p><p>Vickie says that Edge lost the title last Friday night and he will lose something else tonight. She says that she has proof that Edge is the one who assaulted Teddy Long and Edge will lose his job. Vickie laughs maniacally.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=55240">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=55240</a></p>
