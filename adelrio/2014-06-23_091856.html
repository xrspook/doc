                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2014-06-20 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2014-06-23 09:18:56+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2014, smackdown, ppv, mitb, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: HANDICAP MATCH; BLINK AND YOU MIGHT MISS A FEW MATCHES; SIX OF SEVEN IN THE MAIN EVENT SPEAK; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2014-06-20 22:00:58</p><p>We begin with a look at the announcement to John Cena about his stretcher match against Kane.</p><p>We are in Columbus, Ohio and your announcers are Michael ‘Jim Jackson’ Cole and John ‘Woody Hayes’ Layfield.</p><p>We see the two title belts hanging over the ring while Michael and John tell us about the four on three match later tonight involving the seven men in the Money in the Bank WWE Title Match.</p><p>John Cena comes to the ring. He welcomes everyone to Smackdown and he says that there is energy here. John tells everyone to look at the two title belts above his head. They are symbols of excellence. John throws out a few rhetorical questions, including why the title belts are over his head.</p><p>John takes a deep breath and he talks about the history behind the events to lead into the current situation with the WWE World Title being created, the return of Batista, Daniel Bryan winning the title at Wrestlemania, and then Daniel’s injury to set up this ladder match to determine the new WWE World Champion.</p><p>John points out the people in the match and he says that it sounds like a bad joke. You have a Mexican, an Irishman, an Uber European, a Duck Dynasty reject, a prima donna, a security guard, and Dudley Do Right walk into a WWE ring? That is where the comedy stops. He will save you the punchline and he says that he will put all of them in a line and he will punch them.</p><p>He will walk into Money in the Bank, walking up the ladder to victory, and walking out proudly saying the Champ Is Here.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio comes out and he tells John that he should spend less time talking, and more time worrying about Alberto Del Rio. Alberto says that he was the first to qualify and he will be the first to climb the ladder to win the title. He does not think Juanito knows how dangerous he is. He will make sure that John knows as he stands over John as the new WWE World Champion.</p><p>Sheamus’ music plays and he says hello to John and to Bertie. No one has forgotten how dangerous Alberto is, it is that no one gives a damn about what he has to say. Money in the Bank is every man for themselves. Sheamus says that there are some formidable opponents in the ring, but the biggest challenge is him. Trying to figure out how to drag those titles through airport security because he will be the US and WWE World Champion . . . FELLA.</p><p>Cesaro’s music plays and Paul Heyman says that everyone must share his enthusiasm because for the first time ever, the WWE World Title will be decided in a ladder match. It is a match where we will have a new WWE World Champion. Paul says that he can guarantee it will be none of the men currently in the ring. It is every man for themselves, which his client likes.</p><p>There is only one man who has a full time strategist in his corner. He will strategize against everyone to make sure they lose. Paul’s strategy allowed his client to end the Undertaker’s streak at Wrestlemania. His strategy will lead to a new champion . . . whose name is Cesaro.</p><p>Roman Reigns comes through the crowd to the ring. He looks around and then he says ever since Seth Rollins stabbed him in the back, he has had some trouble trusting people. All that matters are the titles. Reigns looks at Cena and he says that it does not matter how many there are or who you think you are, there’s not a man in this ring who is going to stop him now.</p><p>Cena takes off his hat and he takes off his dog tags before taking off his shirt.</p><p>Any physicality is stopped by Randy Orton’s music. Orton comes to the stage and he says that Roman has finally learned that you cannot trust anyone in the WWE. Randy says that he is the face of the WWE and the company was at an all time high when he was the champion. Randy points out that he is not standing in the ring so Roman will not be going through him. Randy says that he will win at Money in the Bank and the titles are coming back to him.</p><p>Reigns goes to the floor and he punches Orton. Orton punches back and Reigns with a head butt. Orton with a forearm and punches but Reigns with a punch and he sends Orton into the stage and ramp. Orton with a punch.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the ring, Cena and Del Rio square off while Cesaro and Sheamus do the same.</p><p>Del Rio and Cesaro are sent to the floor while Orton and Reigns fight to the back.</p><p><strong>Match Number Eight: Roman Reigns, John Cena, and Sheamus versus Alberto Del Rio, Randy Orton, Cesaro (with Paul Heyman), and Bray Wyatt</strong></p><p>Sheamus and Cesaro start things off and they lock up. The referee has to separate them in the corner and then Cesaro with a punch but Sheamus punches back. Cesaro with a kick and forearm followed by a slap to the head.
