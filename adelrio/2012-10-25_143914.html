WE HAVE RECAPS (WITH A NEW TWIST ADDED TO THE 2/21/11 VIDEO)</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2011-02-25 22:02:10</p><p>We are live on tape from Sacramento, California and your announcers are Michael ‘If I can pick on one King, how about a whole team of Kings’ Cole, Josh ‘Did I really have to sit through this week’s NXT’ Mathews, and Booker ‘Why couldn’t I get a video package of me in the rain to hype my return like everyone else’ T.</p><p>We are back and we see the footage of Kofi Kingston’s attack on Alberto Del Rio on Monday night that ended up backfiring on Kofi when Ricardo Rodriguez got involved.</p><p>After the match, Vickie is crying on the floor while Edge and Kelly wave goodbye to her.</p><p>Teddy Long comes out and he is dancing like he is Magnitude’s grandfather. We go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Vickie, Edge, and Teddy are in the ring. Vickie is about to cry while Teddy gets the crowd whipped into a frenzy over Vickie’s impending departure. They start to serenade Vickie.</p><p>Teddy asks Vickie if she has anything to say. Vickie says that she is sorry and she vows to be the best employee while she begs to keep her job.</p><p>Teddy utters the phrase that Vince McMahon made famous and was co-opted by Donald Trump.</p><p>Vickie goes to the referee and she asks him to reverse the decision. Vickie goes to Booker and he laughs at her requests to get her job back. Booker waves goodbye to Vickie. Vickie goes to Cole but he says that he doesn’t know what to do. Cole says that he will try to talk to Teddy and he says that he is so sorry. Vickie begs the cameraman to help her.</p><p>Vickie gets on the mic and she goes back into the ring . . . maybe for the last time. Vickie tells Edge that they have had great chemistry together. She says that her heart was always with him. Vickie says that she will do anything and she says that she needs her job while crying and holding on to Edge’s leg.</p><p>Edge takes the mic and he tells Vickie that he says that he can help her get her job back. Edge thinks about it and he says that he would rather sing. Edge brings back a classic from last week and serenades Vickie out of the ring.</p><p>Vickie stands by the entrance on the stage and screams ‘You Wait’. We then cut to the ring where Alberto Del Rio attacks Edge from behind. Del Rio punches Edge in the head and sends Edge shoulder first into the ring post. Del Rio puts Edge in the cross arm breaker and Edge does not tap and a referee tells Alberto to release the hold. Del Rio lets go of the hold and he tells Edge that he will win at Wrestlemania because it is his destiny.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/article/55557/wwe-smackdown-report-is-edge-a-career-killer-major-upset-just-not-the-one-they-talked-about-a-family-unites-over-cody-rhodes-injury-in-case-you-missed-the-two-big-segments-from-monday-we-have-recaps-with-a-new-twist-added-to-the-22111-video-.html?p=1">http://pwinsider.com/article/55557/wwe-smackdown-report-is-edge-a-career-killer-major-upset-just-not-the-one-they-talked-about-a-family-unites-over-cody-rhodes-injury-in-case-you-missed-the-two-big-segments-from-monday-we-have-recaps-with-a-new-twist-added-to-the-22111-video-.html?p=1</a></p>
