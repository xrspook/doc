Well, at WWE Over the Limit, The Great White will get that opportunity – times three – when he battles challengers Alberto Del Rio, Chris Jericho and Randy Orton in a Fatal 4-Way Match for the World Title.<br><br>Originally slated as a one-on-one title encounter against Del Rio, the pay-per-view showdown picked up two contenders on the May 7 edition of Raw SuperShow. This happened when John Laurinaitis, the General Manager of both Raw and SmackDown, announced that it would be a Fatal 4-Way Match aftter the competitors erupted in a brawl after an intense tag team battle on Raw.<br><br>Sheamus has been on an absolute tear since capturing the World Heavyweight Title from Daniel Bryan in a history-making 18 seconds at WrestleMania, including hard-fought victories over the former champion in a 2-out-of-3 Falls rematch at Extreme Rules and a tremendous win over The World’s Strongest Man Mark Henry on SmackDown. More than ever before, the Irish Superstar has been running on all cylinders, demonstrating the heart of a true World Champion. <br><br>Despite his recent success, however, the odds of The Great White walking out of Over the Limit with the coveted title around his waist are strongly against him. In a Fatal 4-Way Match, any of the four competitors can win the title by scoring a pinfall or submission on any of the other three. In short, Sheamus doesn’t technically have to be beaten to lose his championship.<br><br>In addition to the numbers game, the elite Superstars that The Great White will face are both successful and dangerous even on their worst days – with talents particularly well-suited to this type of match.<br><br>Chris Jericho is a four-time World Champion and one of the most highly decorated Superstars in the history of WWE. Translation: the first-ever Undisputed WWE Champion has always, and will always, know how to win. He’s skilled, adaptable and completely merciless in any and all conditions. Therefore, his fourth World Title could be but a Codebreaker away. <br><br>Randy Orton is a nine-time World Champion, capable of waging war on any battlefield. Besides being an unpredictable and cunning grappler, The Viper’s ability to strike quickly in a number of ways gives him a decisive advantage in this type of contest. The crown jewel of his arsenal in particular – the RKO – is the perfect device to emerge triumphant in the fast-paced chaos of a Fatal 4-Way. <br><br>Del Rio is a two-time World Champion, who’s as confident as he is ruthless. Rising out of the luchador tradition of Mexico, the aristocrat Superstar is no stranger to the tornado-like atmosphere he will encounter at Over the Limit. In fact, he’s already reached the pinnacle of squared circle greatness in a similar environment, having won his second title in a Triple Threat Hell in a Cell WWE Championship Match in 2011. <br><br>At WWE Over the Limit, find out who will emerge from the mayhem of the Fatal 4-Way with the World Heavyweight Championship in his grasp, Sunday May 20 at 8 / 5 PT, only on pay-per-view.</p></blockquote><p>转载自：<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/wweoverthelimit/2012/fatal-4-way-match">http://www.wwe.com/shows/wweoverthelimit/2012/fatal-4-way-match</a><br></p></p>
