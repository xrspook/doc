Weirdly, the same superstars that appeared on this show, did the November 8 show in Glasgow, went to Berlin and then came back to Glasgow again. The date on the eighth was added late on because a show in Madrid didn't sell well. Anyway, Daniel Bryan and AJ were added late on to the two Glasgow shows and Cena/Del Rio was the main event.</p><p>The arena was sold-out. It wasn't on Friday, I didn't go to that show, but I attribute that to it going on sale late as last night was sold-out for many months and the arena always sells out when WWE comes here. I was happy with the line-up, especially given that we didn't get much star power last time, I was happy I got to see Punk, Cena, AJ, Bellas, Bryan and the hometown boy, Drew McIntyre. i took the majority of photos on my camera but a couple on my phone. Decent seats again, here was the view.</p><p>John Cena beat Alberto Del Rio to retain the World Hvt. Championship. A mixed reaction for Cena but a loud one nonetheless. Del Rio was booed heavily. The introductions also provoked loud reactions. I did record Cena's entrance but then deleted it, which was stupid. Good match though, went quite long and lots of 'Lets go Cena/Cena Sucks' chants aswell as just 'Cena' chants. Cena won the match after reversing out of the cross armbreaker and getting Del Rio up and hitting the Attitude Adjustment. Cena didn't spent a long time celebrating afterwards when usually they do. He did clap hands and sign a couple of autographs. Chimel thanked us once again and that was it.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/303637">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/303637</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SHOW RESULTS - 11/10 WWE in Glasgow, Scotland: Cena vs. Del Rio main event, McIntyre home again, IC Title match, more</strong></p><p>Nov 11, 2013 - 2:39:34 AM</p><p>WWE European Tour Results; November 10, 2013; Glasgow, Scotland</p><p>Results submitted by correspondent Cohen</p><p>(8) WWE World Hvt. champion John Cena beat Alberto Del Rio to retain the World Title and close out the show.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_74485.shtml#.UoGGSifZOIw">http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article_74485.shtml#.UoGGSifZOIw</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
