Find out if The Animal was able to roar back Sunday night before his upcoming main event battle at WrestleMania 30.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Animal Unleashes on The Aristocrat</p><p>On the final pay-per-view before his WWE World Heavyweight Championship opportunity at WrestleMania 30, Batista entered a hard-nosed contest against former WWE and World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio. Did Batista continue his winning ways on The Road to WrestleMania?</p><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Batista def. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>February 23, 2014</p><p></p><p>MINNEAPOLIS – Despite a calculated pre-match sneak attack by Alberto Del Rio at Elimination Chamber, Batista roared back to overcome his cunning opponent and set his sights on the main event of WrestleMania 30.<br></p><p>While Batista came to Minneapolis ready to teach Del Rio a lesson he would never forget, The Essence of Execution had other plans. Donning a neck brace and a crutch, the four-time World Champion emerged to declare that The Animal’s assault two weeks ago had left him unable to compete.</p><p>Del Rio’s health seemed to improve in a hurry, though, for when the No. 1 contender to the WWE World Heavyweight Title turned his back to take issue with the referee, the devious Del Rio viciously attacked Batista with his crutch. The Mexican Aristocrat then removed his street clothes to reveal his tights, boots and intent to compete.</p><p>However, that was hardly the end of the story. Once the referee restored order, a hobbled Batista opted to go head-to-head with Del Rio anyway. While his incensed foe continued his malicious assault from the opening bell through the majority of the contest, the resilient determination of The Animal would rise above.</p><p>In the end, Del Rio’s head hit an exposed turnbuckle, allowing Batista to take down The Mexican Aristocrat with a thunderous Batista Bomb.<br></p><p>With Alberto Del Rio out of the way, Batista will continue to charge down The Road to WrestleMania, ready to clash head-on with the WWE World Heavyweight Champion on The Grandest Stage of Them All. Still, with Del Rio doing noticeable damage to both his knee and arm, will The Animal be able to seize the illustrious championship title.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/2014/batista-vs-alberto-del-rio-26179588">http://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/2014/batista-vs-alberto-del-rio-26179588</a></p>
