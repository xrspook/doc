Both Ricardo and Otunga are wearing neckbraces. They're upset about Sheamus and the deposition. Daniel Bryan comes out and then Sheamus comes out. Sheamus isn't buying it and lays Otunga out.</p><p>Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan in a WrestleMania Rematch is announced for later tonight.</p><p>Sheamus defeats Daniel Bryan with the Texas Cloverleaf.</p><p>Dark Match</p><p>Sheamus defeated Alberto Del Rio via submission with the Texas Cloverleaf.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0911/556172/sheamus/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0911/556172/sheamus/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>COMPLETE WWE SMACKDOWN SPOILERS</strong></p><p>By Billy Krotchsen on 2012-09-11 21:04:52</p><p>Smackdown opened with Alberto Del Rio, Ricardo and David Otunga coming out to complain about Sheamus hurting Otunga (now in a neck brace) and using the Brogue Kick. Daniel Bryan came out and claimed he only lost at Wrestlemania because of an illegal kick. This all lead to Sheamus hitting the ring and laying out Otunga again as Del Rio escaped. Sheamus challenged Bryan to a bout later.</p><p>Sheamus defeated Daniel Bryan with the Texas Cloverleaf.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=71858">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=71858</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Second and More Detailed WWE Smackdown Taping Results (SPOILERS)</strong></p><p>Posted by Larry Csonka on 09.12.2012</p><p>Alberto Del Rio came to the ring with Riccardo Rodriguez and David Otunga. They replayed the Sheamus/Otunga video from Raw as well as the end of their match.</p><p>They showed the clip where Sheamus hit his brogue kick on Chritian at the same time last year. Otunga talked to Christian who's via satellite. Then Daniel Bryan came to the ring and was mad at Sheamus. Then Sheamus got to the ring. The segment ended up with Sheamus attacking Otunga by removing his neck brace.</p><p>The segment went for 15 long minutes and didn't get anywhere and people didn't really reacted to it. Bryan got some heat and some "Goat face" chants. Sheamus got a good pop, but that's pretty much it. Still don't know why I should buy the PPV on Sunday with that segment, since Sheamus barely interacted with Del Rio. He did more interacting with Bryan since they are wrestling tonight.</p><p>Sheamus b Daniel Bryan The match was build on the Titantrom as a Wrestlemania 28 rematch. Just before the match started, they showed their Mania with AJ's kiss-of-death. Sheamus won with the Cloverleaf. Ok match. Nothing wrong, nothing great.</p><p>Right after the match, Cole left the booth. Matthews followed soon after. I don't think Cole wanted to have to interact with anyone tonight and rightfully so.</p><p>Dark main-event</p><p>Sheamus vs. Alberto Del Rio w/Rodriguez</p><p>The finish saw Del Rio, who was about to hit Sheamus, who ducked, so Del Rio hit his manager. Sheamus put his Cloverleaf on Del Rio and that was it.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/254578">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/254578</a></p>
