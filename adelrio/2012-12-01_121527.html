                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2012-11-30 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2012-12-01 12:15:27+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2012, smackdown, john_cena, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: WILL THE BRIEFCASE BE ON THE LINE?; SIX MAN TAG ACTION; DAMIEN SANDOW TRIES TO EDUCATE THE MASSES; I THINK WE KNOW THE MAIN EVENT FOR RAW OR SMACKDOWN NEXT WEEK</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2012-11-30 21:58:43</p><p>Tonight on Smackdown, will The Shield continue their attack on the WWE? Will Ryback do something on this week’s show? What will Sheamus do this week to prepare for his World Title Match against Big Show at TLC? It looks like he will be facing Dolph Ziggler.</p><p>This week, Smackdown is in Bossier City, Louisiana and your announcers are John ‘Flash Flood’ Layfield and Josh ‘Day After Tomorrow in the Locker Room’ Mathews.</p><p>John Cena makes his way to the ring to take the traditional promo segment to start off Smackdown spot.</p><p>In case you missed Raw, John Cena faced Dolph Ziggler and John’s knee gave out again. We then saw Vickie Guerrero and AJ Lee get involved. Ziggler fell victim to the Attitude Adjustment and John Cena won the match.</p><p>John says that he wants the world to know that this is Smackdown. He says that something seems mysterious. He is John Cena and not one of the regulars on Smackdown. He is excited for the main event on this week’s show. Mr. Money in the Bank Dolph Ziggler will be involved. There is a reason why he is focusing on Dolph Ziggler. It is because Dolph is busy poking fingers into his business.</p><p>John says that he is poking his fingers into Dolph’s business tonight. Dolph’s greatest accomplishment is being the World Champion . . . for two minutes. A glorious one hundred twenty seconds. Dolph’s biggest fear, other than everyone finding out that he is a man stuck in a teenage girl’s body, is losing the Money in the Bank briefcase. As that case goes, so does his identity. He hides behind the power of Vickie Guerrero and says that he can hang with the top superstars in the WWE.</p><p>On Monday, Dolph got to test that by facing on him Raw. John reminds us that Dolph lost that match. The reason why he is here tonight, it is because Dolph is not in a match, he is in a fight. Dolph will have to survive a match with Sheamus.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring. Alberto tells Cena that he shouldn’t be worried about Dolph Ziggler. Cena should be worried about him because this is his house and his show.</p><p>Cena says that this is a WWE broadcast so the show belongs to the WWE Universe.</p><p>Alberto says that Smackdown is his show and he calls Cena a gringo estupido. Alberto wants to know if he has to remind Cena that he is a former Money in the Bank briefcase holder, or a Royal Rumble winner, or a former two time WWE Champion?</p><p>Alberto tells Cena that the last time they met in the ring, he destroyed Cena. Alberto tells Cena to leave his show and his ring . . . right now.</p><p>John thinks about it for a moment and he says that he did not forget those things. John does not want to go because he has a match with Alberto Del Rio and it is right now.</p><p>Cena punches Del Rio and Alberto goes to the floor.</p><p>We go to commercial.</p><p><strong>Match Number One: John Cena versus Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez)</strong></p><p>They lock up and Del Rio with a side head lock.
