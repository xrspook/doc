For the first time since the last time there was a Job Performance Evaluation, Vickie Guerrero goes under the gun as Vince McMahon, Triple H, and Stephanie McMahon let Vickie know of her fate as the person who is in charge of Raw to the extent that she does not do anything that a McMahon disagrees with. Speaking of three people who put fear in the hearts of all in the WWE, the Wyatt Family is supposed to debut tonight. When is their job performance evaluation?</p><p>We begin with an extended cut of the Wyatt Family video.</p><p>We are in Baltimore, Maryland and your announcers are Michael ‘In the building where the guy writing this report attended his first wrestling show’ Cole, Jerry ‘Where getting crabs is not always a bad thing’ Lawler and John ‘We smell spices on Monday Night’ Layfield.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Sin Cara versus Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>The lights go down and they lock up. Del Rio with kicks and punches. Del Rio with a savate kick to Cara and then he tries to hip toss Cara to the floor but Cara bounces off the ropes and hits an arm drag. Cara with another arm drag to Del Rio. Del Rio with shoulders in the corner. Del Rio misses a charge into the corner and Cara with a head scissors. Cara with a kick and a near fall.</p><p>Cara goes up top and Del Rio with an enzuigiri but he can only get a two count. Del Rio with knees to the back of the head and then he goes after the mask. Del Rio with a front face lock but Cara with punches. Del Rio with a knee. Cara with a handspring back elbow and Del Rio goes down. Del Rio with the step up enzuigiri and he gets a near fall.</p><p>Dolph’s music plays and Del Rio forgets that he is in a match and Cara gets a near fall with a rollup. Dolph apologizes to Del Rio for what he did to Ricardo. He is going to introduce Del Rio the way that he should. Del Rio watches while Cara hits an enzuigiri and a slingshot senton for a near fall. Del Rio with a German suplex while Dolph tells Del Rio he has no chance to retain his title.</p><p>Del Rio with a super kick to Cara and then Del Rio goes after Ziggler on the floor. Del Rio and Ziggler exchange punches. Del Rio with a boot to the head.
