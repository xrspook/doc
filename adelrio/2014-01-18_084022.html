Through WWE’s expanded partnership with Pearson Foundation’s digital reading initiative, We Give Books, and YALSA, children between ages 4 and 12 can select a WWE Superstar Reading Buddy and read digital books to participate, while teens ages 13 to 18 can select a WWE Superstar Pen Pal, read a book and write an essay.</p><p>WWE will make a financial contribution to We Give Books and YALSA to support literacy initiatives and provide access to books for children across the United States. WWE and its Superstars will also continue to host reading celebrations, visiting kids at local schools and libraries to stress the importance of reading. The celebrations will include special visits from the We Give Books ReadMobile. We Give Books is a digital initiative created by the Penguin Group and the Pearson Foundation to equip families, classrooms and libraries with print and online books for children.</p><p>Additionally, WWE will utilize all of its platforms, including TV broadcasts, Live Events, digital and social media to encourage children to read at school, at home, in their local library or wherever they’re inspired to read.</p><p>“Encouraging a lifelong love of reading is at the heart of the We Give Books initiative,” said Pearson Foundation President and CEO Mark Nieker. “Through this important partnership with WWE and YALSA, we are looking to reach more children and their families this year with the message of reading, giving and sharing.”</p><p>“It’s a sobering fact that nearly 40 percent of high school graduates are not proficient in traditional literacy skills,” said YALSA President Shannon Peterson. “WWE, Pearson and YALSA can together make strides toward alleviating this societal problem and building brighter futures for our nation’s youth.”</p><p>“WWE is proud to continue its long-standing commitment to literacy initiatives through our partnership with We Give Books and YALSA,” said Stephanie McMahon, Chief Brand Officer of WWE. “Children are more digitally connected today than ever before and the WrestleMania Reading Challenge provides them with a unique opportunity to read books both online and in the library.”</p><p>Studies show that nothing is more important to a child’s overall success than reading at grade level by third grade. Developing early literacy skills sets a child up for success in school and life.</p><p>For more information or to participate in the WrestleMania Reading Challenge, visit WWEReadingSuperstar.com.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://community.wwe.com/education/news/2014-wrestlemania-reading-challenge-launches">https://community.wwe.com/education/news/2014-wrestlemania-reading-challenge-launches</a></p>
