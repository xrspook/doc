Buckle up, WWE Universe, this ride just took a wild turn.</p><p><strong>John Cena def. CM Punk</strong></p><p>An already tangled web of deceit surrounding the WWE Championship has grown into a snarled jungle of falsehoods, half-truths and backstabbing. As John Cena and CM Punk clashed for the opportunity to face WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio at Night of Champions, The Mexican Aristocrat and Mr. John Laurinaitis added to the intrigue by sitting at ringside to observe the match.</p><p>Once the bell sounded, Punk and Cena continued their animosity unabated, both colliding with and countering each other. And then another curious thread was woven into the already contentious tapestry. Kevin Nash emerged inside the arena, distracting The Second City Savior and allowing The Cenation Commander-in-Chief the victory.</p><p>John Cena vs. CM Punk - No. 1 Contender's Match Interesting. Especially since Mr. John Laurinitais had informed Triple H that Nash, his longtime friend, had been in a car accident while driving to the airport prompting The Game to leave the show in Laurinaitis’ hands.</p><p>The tumultuous turn of events prompted more questions than answers. For instance, did Mr. John Laurinaitis really receive a phone call informing him Nash had been in a car accident, or did he just want to get Triple H out of the arena? And is the current WWE Champion, Alberto Del Rio, mixed up in the deceptions?</p><p><strong>Triple H confronted Kevin Nash; CM Punk got laid out</strong></p><p>For Triple H, it was high time to clear the air. During his first pay-per-view as WWE COO, The Game’s good friend, Kevin Nash, had attacked newly-crowned WWE Champion CM Punk, allowing Alberto Del Rio to coast to a WWE Title reign after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract.</p><p>In the wake of the scandal, Nash explained that he’d received a text from Triple H’s phone instructing him to “stick” the winner of the WWE Title Match. WWE’s COO confirmed that the text did, in fact, come from his phone, but he insisted he was not the sender before vowing to uncover the identity of the real culprit.</p><p>Before The Game could finish his pronouncement, though, CM Punk emerged to challenge his version of the truth. When hostilities between Triple H and Punk became heated, Nash intervened with a cheap shot across Punk’s jaw. The blow crumpled The Second City Savior and ticked off The Cerebral Assassin, who left the ring in a huff – followed by Big Daddy Cool.</p><p><strong>WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio def. John Morrison</strong></p><p></p><p>In his first title defense against Rey Mysterio, WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio put The Master of the 619 out of commission with a serious injury requiring surgery (STORY). This week, in a non-title match, Del Rio failed to put his opponent, John Morrison, on the shelf, but he did slip by with an impressive victory over the unpredictable Superstar.</p><p><strong>WWE COO Triple H announced CM Punk vs. John Cena main event match</strong></p><p>As the controversy surrounding the WWE Title continues to loom over Monday Night Raw like a dark, ominous cloud, Triple H decided to exert his control, raining on the parades of both CM Punk and John Cena. The WWE COO interrupted the pair, who had been squabbling over which would get to invoke their rematch clause first and challenge current WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio.</p><p>As The Game reminded them, it’s not they who decide when their rematch clauses get invoked – it’s Triple H himself. The COO then announced that former WWE Champions Punk and Cena must face off in the night’s main event, with the winner earning a title match against The Mexican Aristocrat at Night of Champions in four weeks.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-08-22/results">http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-08-22/results</a></p>
