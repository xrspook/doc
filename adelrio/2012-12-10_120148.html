Ryback wins via disqualification with interference from Ricardo Rodriguez. Ryback hits Shellshocked on both.</p><p>At the conclusion, all the Superstars came on stage while Cena thanked the Military for their service. Santa Claus came out in a sleigh with Superstars dressed as reindeer. The Usos, Zack Ryder, PTP, Santino Marella, Justin Gabriel and Yoshi Tatsu were reindeer. I think Mick Foley was Santa but I couldn't tell from where I was seated. Triple H was present but only made an appearance at the conclusion. I saw John Laurinaitis, Dean Malenko, Road Dogg, Micheal Hayes during the conclusion as well. Other superstars at the conclusion were AJ Lee, Kaitlyn, Ted DiBiase, Alicia Fox and others.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1209/558607/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/1209/558607/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Tribute To The Troops Results (SPOILERS)</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 12.09.2012</p><p>The Scope Arena is about 90% full, expected a full house as every single ticket given was complimentary. The MWR passed out tickets all last week; if you wore your uniform, you could get your ticket upgraded (lower level).</p><p><strong>Second match: Alberto Del Rio vs. Ryback</strong></p><p>ADR showed up in a new Camaro. It turns out that it is Ricardo's birthday; ADR asks the crowd to help him sing Happy Birthday, which ADR sings in Spanish. USA chants ensue...During the match, Ricardo jumped on the back of Ryback which gave him the win via DQ. ADR exits the ring and Ricardo takes a Shellshock for this birthday present. ADR comes back in the ring and gets a Shellshock himself.</p><p>After the match was over, everybody from the back came out while John Cena stayed in the ring. He wishes us all a happy holiday season and advises us that somebody is missing. Jingle Bells starts playing and Santino comes out with antlers portraying Rudolph, there are other guys dressed as reindeer and they are pulling a sleigh with Santa on it.</p><p>I'm not sure where the cameras cut off at, but the show was awesome, because it was free. The merchandise tables were pretty sad, but all in all, everybody seemed to go home happy.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/265897">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/265897</a></p><p></p>
