Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>November 24, 2013</p><p></p><p></p><p>BOSTON – Brushing off a lingering injury, World Heavyweight Champion John Cena heroically overcame the treacherous Alberto Del Rio in an extremely hard-fought World Title Match at Survivor Series.</p><p>On route to WWE’s fall classic, the WWE Universe was unsure whether Cena’s surgically repaired triceps would hold up against his notoriously vicious No. 1 contender and his devastating Cross Armbreaker – especially since the Del Rio has spent the better part of the weeks leading up Survivor Series attacking The Champ.</p><p>However, the intestinal fortitude that helped make Cena a 14-time World Champion would ultimately put those doubts to rest – starting with the valiant titleholder refusing to wear his protective brace as he came to the ring to face the dangerous 4-time World Champion.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2013/world-heavyweight-champion-john-cena-vs-alberto-del-rio-26162290">http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2013/world-heavyweight-champion-john-cena-vs-alberto-del-rio-26162290</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion John Cena def. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>November 24, 2013</p><p></p><p></p><p>While it was true that Cena had an incredible record of seven wins and only one loss at Survivor Series heading into the contest, the skillful Del Rio would waste little time executing an aggressive offense designed to take this Champ out early. This would include hurling the titleholder’s hurt appendage into the unforgiving steel steps, attacking him from the top rope and generally targeting his opponent’s weakness at every pass.</p><p>Things went from bad to worse when the action spilled outside the ring, as Del Rio mercilessly lunched The Champ in the ringside barricade and mocked him to boot.</p><p>Every time that Cena would start to build momentum – whether it be knocking back his No. 1 contender with a earth-shattering dropkickas his attacker came off the top rope, or hitting the Five Knuckle Shuffle – Del Rio would find a counter and take Cena back down to the mat.</p><p>Still, no matter what he did, the Mexican Superstar could not put away the ultra-resilient Cenation Leader– as the World Heavyweight Champion kicked out of pin attempt after pin attempt – leaving every ounce of his Hustle, Loyalty and Respect on the field of battle!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2013/world-heavyweight-champion-john-cena-vs-alberto-del-rio-26162290/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2013/world-heavyweight-champion-john-cena-vs-alberto-del-rio-26162290/page-2</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion John Cena def. Alberto Del Rio</strong></p><p>BY Michael Burdick</p><p>November 24, 2013</p><p></p><p></p><p>Once again looking to put away the iron titleholder, Del Rio finally went for the Cross Armbreaker, only to find himself in the STF! But the Essence of Excellence was not going to give up either and reached the ropes to break the hold, showing equal resilience.</p><p>In the height of the action, when Del Rio finally cinched in the Cross Armbreaker on the arm in question, Cena again roared back, miraculously lifting Del Rio up with incredible strength and hurling him back to the canvas.</p><p>And when Del Rio attempted a third Cross Armbreaker, it proved to be one attempt too many. For Cena would counter with an Attitude Adjustment out of nowhere and bring the WWE Universe it its feet with another gutsy successful title defense!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2013/world-heavyweight-champion-john-cena-vs-alberto-del-rio-26162290/page-3">http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2013/world-heavyweight-champion-john-cena-vs-alberto-del-rio-26162290/page-3</a></p><p></p><p>Tough Break for Heart of Cenation?</p><p>With thousands of Bostonians rooting him on, could hometown hero John Cena fend off Alberto Del Rio's relentless attack and retain his World Heavyweight Championship?</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Champ Thrives at Survivor Series</p><p>Despite lingering suspicion that he wouldn't be fit for action, World Heavyweight Champion John Cena persevered against the ever-dangerous former champion, Alberto Del Rio.
