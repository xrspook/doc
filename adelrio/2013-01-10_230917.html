Cara was actually ready to work this week and was not used.</p><p>The idea is that they will push Del Rio harder than Mysterio and Cara with the hopes of making a genuine Mexican draw out of him. This was actually the original idea when WWE signed Del Rio a few years ago.</p><p>The Last Man Standing stipulation was added to the match on SmackDown so Del Rio could survive tons of punishment before coming back to win the title.</p><p>There is talk that Del Rio's title win was originally planned for Monday's RAW but he wasn't there due to personal reasons so they moved it to Tuesday at the SmackDown tapings.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlesite.com/wwe/backstage-news-on-why-alberto-del-rio-won-the-world-title/">http://www.wrestlesite.com/wwe/backstage-news-on-why-alberto-del-rio-won-the-world-title/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Kevin Nash Joins HBK At NXT, Heat On Rey Mysterio And Sin Cara, Royal Rumble Title Match Updates</strong></p><p>By Marc Middleton | January 10, 2013</p><p>As noted, Eve Torres vs. Kaitlyn in a Lumberjills Match for the WWE Divas Title will likely be added to Royal Rumble. This would play off the finish on Monday's RAW and make sure all the Divas get a Rumble payoff. With Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio in a rematch for the World Heavyweight Title being planned for Rumble, it's possible that match may happen with some kind of stipulation also.</p><p>With WWE making the switch to Alberto Del Rio as their top Latin babyface, The Wrestling Observer reports that there is talk that they have given up on Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara in that role. The planned match between Rey and Cara for WrestleMania 29 may be off.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0110/559362/kevin-nash/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0110/559362/kevin-nash/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Big Update on Alberto Del Rio's WWE Career (Spoiler)</strong></p><p>By Sharon Glencross (Featured Columnist) on January 9, 2013</p><p>In this week's (subscribers-only) F4W Newsletter, Bryan Alvarez notes that the company is keen to rectify its mistakes with Del Rio and push him as its next big babyface star. WWE feels that the belt will aid his cause greatly.</p><p>They decided very recently that they are going with Del Rio as their new Hispanic superstar, with the idea being that they're going to push him harder than both Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara and try to make a genuine Mexican drawing card out of him. This had been the idea when he was first signed. It's possible they were going to wait until the Rumble and perhaps decided that since they botched up his turn so bad they needed to change the title and try to remedy the situation quicker, plus a title change would have been lost in the shuffle at Rumble...</p><p>Considering the disappointing state of Sin Cara's WWE career, as well as Rey Mysterio's age and litany of knee troubles, it's not a surprise the company has chosen to go with Del Rio as its next big Hispanic star.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1478308-big-update-on-alberto-del-rios-wwe-career">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1478308-big-update-on-alberto-del-rios-wwe-career</a></p>
