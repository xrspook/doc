After being RKO’d earlier in the evening by Orton, Del Rio unleashed a furious backstage assault on The Viper, just as the target of his rage was readying himself for a World Title No. 1 Contender’s Match against Big Show. Not only did the attack ultimately contribute to Orton falling to The World’s Largest Athlete, but also The Mexican Aristocrat would immediately rekindle his onslaught as the smoke cleared — a display captured by WWE.com after SmackDown went off the air.</p><p>The smug Del Rio emerged the following week with his own impression of WWE’s Apex Predator, designed to add insult to injury and ridicule one of the most calculating grapplers ever to step through the ropes. This drew the ire of The Viper, who returned to the Oct. 12 edition of SmackDown to execute a surprise assault of his own, punishing Del Rio before RKO’ing Ricardo Rodriguez onto the announce table as his adversary fled his wrath.</p><p>As a result of the growing animosity between them, a match was announced during the following Monday’s Raw.</p><p>It’s fitting that the showdown between two of the most ruthlessly sly Superstars in the squared circle will occur in a pay-per-view containing the word “Hell,” as it will surely prove as merciless and it will be hazardous.</p><p>Since his emergence in August 2010, Del Rio’s exploits have been well documented in his constant quest to reach glory by any means necessary — from engineering long-standing injuries to the likes of Rey Mysterio and Christian, to locking John Cena out of a Triple Threat WWE Championship Hell in a Cell Match in 2011, to having World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus’ Brogue Kick banned in 2012.</p><p>While he is certainly well-to-do and completely arrogant, there is no denying that Del Rio is an extremely dangerous competitor, one who has already made Orton tap out on the Aug. 24 episode of SmackDown with his dreaded Cross Armbreaker.</p><p>That is exactly the type of opponent that Orton prefers to feast upon. The nine-time World Champion is about as brutal as they come, known as much for his ruthless brawls outside the ropes — against the likes of Wade Barrett, Cody Rhodes and Triple H — as he is for the aggressive wars he has waged inside the ring. The serpentine Superstar thrives on conflict and can end any threat the second his opponent lets his guard down with three little letters: RKO!</p><p>Which of the two extremely treacherous warriors will rise above? Find out Oct. 28 at 8 ET/5 PT, only on pay-per-view.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2012/randy-orton-alberto-del-rio-26060057">http://www.wwe.com/shows/hellinacell/2012/randy-orton-alberto-del-rio-26060057</a></p>
