We had fourth row seats. On my way to my seat, I ran into a late-arriving Drew McIntyre, who asked me if I knew where backstage was, but I didn't. (I was wearing a jacket and tie and he may have thought I was some sort of official.)<br><br>Next was the main event triple threat World Title match switching out Christian for Alberto Del Rio. Ricardo Rodriguez introduced Del Rio. The house mic was not working at first, and Rodriguez wanted to fight Kimel. Del Rio autographed a fan's sign, then ripped it up. Bryan was out next. Bryan fans were not in the majority tonight, as there were dueling "Yes / No" chants, with the No's usually being louder. Del Rio and Rodriguez mocked the Yes chants before Sheamus came out to a large pop. His shoulder was bandaged, selling the injury from Smackdown.<br><br>(9) World Hvt. champion Sheamus defeated Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio in a triple threat match to retain the World Title. Bryan and Del Rio started out arguing, so Sheamus shoulder-blocked them both. Eventually, Del Rio took control while Bryan was on the outside. Sheamus turned the tables on Del Rio. Bryan tried a sneak attack, but took 10 clubbing blows from Sheamus for his troubles. Bryan recovered quickly enough to break things up between Sheamus and Del Rio and send Del Rio to the outside. Bryan worked over Sheamus while Rodriguez tried to revive Del Rio. Del Rio and Bryan then shook hands and teamed up on Sheamus, including tearing the bandages off Sheamus. Del Rio put Sheamus in the cross-arm breaker, but Bryan broke it up with a diving headbutt off the top rope. Bryan went for the Yes! Lock, but Sheamus countered it into a slingshot, knocking Bryan into Del Rio, sending Del Rio off the apron into Rodriguez. Sheamus then hit the Brogue Kick on Bryan for the pin.<br><br>Afterward, Sheamus celebrated with the fans to send everyone home happy. Very good main event match. All in all, a very entertaining show. No return date was announced.<br><br>Biggest Pops:<br><br>- Orton<br>- Big Show<br>- Sheamus<br><br>Biggest Heat:<br><br>- Rhodes<br>- Christian<br>- McIntyre</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/237026">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/237026</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>CHRISTIAN RETURNS, 5/5 SMACKDOWN BRAND RESULTS FROM ASHEVILLE, NC</strong><br><br>By Mike Jenkins on 2012-05-06 13:36:37<br><br>Sheamus beat Alberto Del Rio and Daniel Bryan in a Triple Threat match to return the World Title.<br><br>It was a sparse crowd for the return of Christian but I am glad I was there to see it. Overall, it was a fun show.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=68200">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=68200</a><br></p>
