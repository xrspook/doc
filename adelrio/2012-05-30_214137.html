Someone of his pedigree deserves a well-made, researched and harvested DVD Compilation and I’m pleased to say that this is what we have here. I will begin by saying that this DVD set has importance due to the quality of the contained footage. Whilst CMLL is generally quite lenient and generous with their footage being uploaded to youtube, we do tend to see lower grade video as a result. Here we have perhaps some of the better quality footage available, in particular for the Hustle Match, which isn’t easy to find and also for the CMLL matches.<br><br>Regrettably, we don’t begin at the outset of his career, but rather, four years in. This is a shame when the set is a part of a career anthology but doesn’t start at the beginning, however this is forgivable when you understand just how difficult earlier footage is to obtain. Although it would be nice to see these missing encounters in the future, you don’t feel you miss out too much because the progression of his abilities and smoothing of his skills is obvious within this compilation.<br><br>Outside of the quality of the video is the undeniable quality of the matches. This selection is so entertaining and although it is easy to dip in and out of, it is actually difficult to switch off as it is so incredibly enjoyable. I have watched it three times thusfar, once to just watch alone, once for the review and once to show a friend who is an Alberto Del Rio fan but unfamiliar with his pre-WWE career and it has become more fun to watch with every viewing. At almost two hours in length, you get a generous amount of wrestling for your money here and it is all top class action.<br><br>I really cannot recommend this title enough and am looking forward to Volume Two immensely. I usually try to find some downsides whilst reviewing to cover all bases, even if they are petty complaints, but it’s hard to do here, it’s a very solid set. I tried to put myself in the place of someone who may not be familiar with Lucha Libre and what they may find issue with, but aside from things like lack of promos/interviews or not understanding commentary so not knowing who some wrestlers were or why they were against each other, I can’t really think of anything. My friend found it accessible and loved it as much as I did.<br><br>I would honestly say that whether you are a WWE fan who is interested in what ADR used to do, or someone familiar with him who just wants to own a compilation of his pre-WWE career, or a big fan who is collecting a retrospective, like myself, there’s something for everyone here, and the added bonus of his WWE Debut is a great addition to the disc.<br><br>Considering everything I have said, I would give the best of Dos Caras Jr Vol. 1 a richly deserved 8/10.</p></blockquote><p>转载自：<a target="_blank" href="http://luchareviews.wordpress.com/2012/05/16/dvd-review-the-best-of-dos-caras-jr-volume-one/">http://luchareviews.wordpress.com/2012/05/16/dvd-review-the-best-of-dos-caras-jr-volume-one/</a><br></p></p>
