Alberto Del Rio complained about how Booker T waited to revoke the Brogue Kick right before the match on Sunday. Booker T said he does feel bad but Del Rio needs to earn another title match and implied he could do so by winning the tag match tonight.</p><p>Lilian Garcia announced the main event for tonight. It looks like they are taping it early tonight since the dark match is advertised as Randy Orton vs. Del Rio vs. Sheamus for the title.</p><p>Del Rio makes his entrance to boos followed by Vickie Guerrero saying "Excuse me" as she was booed to announce Dolph Ziggler, who got no reaction at all. Orton got tons of cheers. The crowd was hot for this show! I haven't heard it this loud in Philly for some time. Sheamus got a reaction just below Randy Orton's in all cheers.</p><p>Sheamus and Randy Orton defeated Alberto Del Rio and Dolph Ziggler. Vickie, Ricardo, Del Rio, and Ziggler were huddled at ringside before the match got underway. Sheamus and Del Rio started. Late in the match, Orton went to his vintage move set of the scoop slam and DDT through the ropes. Ziggler got involved and Del Rio got a back breaker for a two count. More offense for the heels as a RKO chant broke out. Orton went for a tag but Del Rio stopped him until Orton was able to get Del Rio out of the ring. Orton made the hot tag as well as Del Rio. Sheamus and Ziggler went back and forth. Del Rio got involved but ended up taking an RKO as Sheamus hit his Brogue Kick on Ziggler for the win.</p><p>Sheamus and Orton play to the hot crown and slap hands with fans as they cut to a shot outside the Wells Fargo Center Daniel Bryan makes a silent Entrance with the lights off for his match.</p><p>Lilian Garcia told the fans about the Breast Cancer Awareness campaign and thanked fans for coming. No dark match for the night despite the advertised Triple Threat. Overall, an average show with a very hot Philly crowd.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/255463/Complete-WWE-Smackdown-Taping-Results-%28SPOILERS%29.htm">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/255463/Complete-WWE-Smackdown-Taping-Results-%28SPOILERS%29.htm</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>COMPLETE SMACKDOWN SPOILERS FROM PHILADELPHIA</strong></p><p>By Billy Krotchsen on 2012-09-18 21:46:16</p><p>World champ Sheamus and Randy Orton defeated Alberto Del Rio and Dolph Ziggler when Sheamus nailed the Brogue Kick on Ziggler for the win.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/article/72048/complete-smackdown-spoilers-from-philadelphia.html">http://www.pwinsider.com/article/72048/complete-smackdown-spoilers-from-philadelphia.html</a></p>
