The WWE Universe has been buzzing about how these injuries might affect Rhodes’ status for Friday’s SmackDown and Sunday’s Survivor Series. In the event the Team Rhodes Scholars member is somehow unable to compete Sunday, what could that mean for the other four members of Team Ziggler — Dolph Ziggler, Alberto Del Rio, Wade Barrett and Damien Sandow — when they battle Team Foley in a Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match?</p><p>The loss of the former Intercontinental Champion would definitely hurt Team Ziggler. If anyone can tough it out, however, it would be Rhodes. This, after all, is a Superstar who competed for months with a protective mask covering his hideous and painful facial injuries, a Superstar who for years now has battled the biggest and best WWE has to offer. Though often outspoken, no one can dispute Rhodes’ toughness, gameness or ability to recover.</p><p>If it turns out he is indeed not cleared or able to compete, though, several Superstars would bring something unique to The Showoff’s Survivor Series tag team. WWE.com has five possible replacements who could help carry Team Ziggler to victory this Sunday.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2012/if-rhodes-is-out-who-is-in-26068942">http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2012/if-rhodes-is-out-who-is-in-26068942</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Ricardo Rodriguez</strong></p><p></p><p>Since Alberto Del Rio is already part of Team Ziggler, his personal ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez could make a viable candidate to replace Cody Rhodes at WWE’s November classic.</p><p>Although he’s known primarily for his exaggerated and energetic ring introductions of The Mexican Aristocrat, Rodriguez has proven he’s not hesitant to get in on the action whenever he feels like it. In addition to sometimes competing alongside Del Rio in tag team matches, the tuxedoed mic man is a veteran of the 2012 Royal Rumble, and he took arguably the biggest fall of 2011 at WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs last year.</p><p>Rodriguez might not fully replace Rhodes’ experience, athleticism and ruthless ambition, but the personal ring announcer has repeatedly thrown his body on the line, whether it’s interfering in one of Del Rio’s matches to protect his employer or getting involved in an underhanded attack. If Rhodes were unable to compete Sunday, Ricardo Rodriguez may have to exchange his tuxedo for his trunks.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2012/if-rhodes-is-out-who-is-in-26068942/page-2">http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2012/if-rhodes-is-out-who-is-in-26068942/page-2</a></p>
