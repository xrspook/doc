TV matches offer so little variation often because of time restraints, commercial breaks, and predictable booking. In many ways, you see the participants at their cores, stripped down to basics. Here, we see Sheamus as a powerhouse and Dolph Ziggler as a good wrestler who bumps well, but was clearly never going to win. The best he could shoot for was 'looking good in defeat.' It's the same Sheamus and Ziggler we usually see in TV matches. And this was a solid match. No complaints on my end about it -- nor about the post-match attack by Alberto Del Rio. But, is there anything of any consequence to say? That's how you wind up with matches that you don't have any negatives to discuss that get 7.0 or so out of ten. Self-imposed limitations.<br><br>Rating: 7.0 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/241122">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/241122</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>411's WWE RAW Report 6.4.12</strong><br><br>Posted by Tony Acero on 06.04.2012 <br><br>Match 1: Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler<br>Lock up but Dolph fights out with some rights. Sheamus sends Dolph into t he corner and hits some rights, then whips him into the corner again and Dolp hits an elbow. Ziggler runs nito Sheamus, floats over and tries for a sunset flip but Sheamus hits the Finlay Roll and a pin for 1...2..NO!. Sheamus grabs the chin of Dolph on the outside and pulls him towards the ropes. Sheamus hits the ropes then flies towards Dolph, but Dolph pulls the ropes and out goes Sheamus. Sheamus pulls Dolph out from under the ropes. He lifts up Dolph on his shoulder, Dolph floats over and tries to send Sheamus into the pole, but Shemaus stops it. Sheamus sends Dolph into the stair,s but Dolph hops atop them and joms to the opposite side. Vickie is here to yell at him, so Dolph runs into the ring and baseball slides the distracted Sheamus as we go to break.<br><br>Back, and both men are locked up. Sheamus is hitting some headbutts, then the ropes, but Dolph hits a high knee to the gut then locks a chinlock/chicken weing. During the break, Dolph sent Sheamus into the pole shoulder first. Sheamus is trying to power out of the hold, and does with a headbut then an arm drag. Sheamus with an axe handle, another to Dolph.

Covers for 1...2...3!!<br>Winner: Sheamus (**1/2)<br>The commercial broke up what was a pretty good flowing match that went much better and longer on Smackdown.<br><br>Sheamus is celebrating at the top of the stage when from out of nowhere, Alberto Del Rio comes flying out and attacks Sheamus. Del RIo has Sheamus trapped up against the big WWE logo. Ricardo comes out and grabs the leg of Sheamus, trapping him as Del Rio goes to work. Sheamus is hanging off the edge of the stage.
