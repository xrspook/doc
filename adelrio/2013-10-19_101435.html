Despite the No Disqualification stipulation and Dean Ambrose at ringside, the brothers were able to defeat the Hounds of Justice thanks to a punch from Big Show. What is Show’s status with WWE? What will happen with the Tag Titles?</p><p>We are in Kansas City, Missouri and your announcers are John ‘Can we get BBQ Torito’ Layfield and Michael ‘Is it better to be a British Royal or a Kansas City Royal’ Cole.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio walks through the back as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Alberto Del Rio has a flag with him in the ring before Josh Mathews enters to ask him some questions. Josh asks Alberto about his match against John Cena, but first we have a video package.</p><p>Josh wants Alberto’s reaction. Alberto says that he was carrying the Mexican flag because he is Mexico’s greatest export. He is Mexico’s God’s Gift to Humanity. He says that everyone are just gringos. They have no passion or soul. They have no Mexican passion. The person representing the gringos is John Cena. He is the Ultimate Gringo.</p><p>Who does John Cena think he is to come back from surgery to face Alberto Del Rio? Alberto tells John that you have to start at the bottom. Is John going loco? John has been out of action for the last two months because he sprained his elbow?</p><p>John is going soft. He is not the man he used to be . . . except for your ego because it keep growing day by day. After you lose to Alberto Del Rio at Hell in a Cell, you will be just like all of these gringos . . . a nobody.</p><p>Alberto has one more thing to say. He asks John if he wants to know what is going to happen to his injured arm . . . watch this. Alberto attacks Josh Mathews and he applies the cross arm breaker.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/article/80985/wwe-smackdown-report-six-man-tag-main-event-zeb-is-full-of-bull-who-needs-a-job-to-be-in-the-ring-and-more.html?p=1">http://pwinsider.com/article/80985/wwe-smackdown-report-six-man-tag-main-event-zeb-is-full-of-bull-who-needs-a-job-to-be-in-the-ring-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
