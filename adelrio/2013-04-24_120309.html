The entire section of the top tier is closed off.</p><p>A WrestleMania recap was shown. The crowd is not as active as last night.</p><p>Jack Swagger vs. Alberto Del Rio in a No DQ match is up first. Ricardo Rodriguez got a good pop announcing Del Rio, and the crowd chanted along with him. The crowd was chanting "Si Si!" There were also "Ole Ole" and "We Want Tables" chants throughout. The match saw kendo sticks, chairs and ladders used. Swagger defeated Del Rio in <strong>an excellent 12-minute match</strong> with the gutwrench powerbomb after hitting him with a ladder.</p><p>There was a backstage segment with Matt Striker and Booker T. A bunch of stars interrupted.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0423/562255/spoilers-ongoing-wwe-smackdown-results/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0423/562255/spoilers-ongoing-wwe-smackdown-results/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>FULL SPOILERS FROM TODAY'S SMACKDOWN TAPING IN LONDON, ENGLAND</strong></p><p>By Ian Ogier on 2013-04-23 14:36:44</p><p>SmackDown started off with Jack Swagger beating Alberto Del Rio cleanly by pinfall in a good No Holds Barred match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=77123">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=77123</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>More Detailed WWE Smackdown Taping Report (SPOILERS)</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 04.23.2013</p><p>Lilian Garcia kicked off the Smackdown taping with a pitch perfect rendition of our frankly dreadful national anthem, God Save the Queen. Fair play to Lilian. She made the dreary dirge sound almost inspiring with her impressive pipes.</p><p>There's a promo on the big screen saying Taker returns to Smackdown tonight, suggesting he isn't just here for the dark main event as I assumed….</p><p>Jack Swagger beat Alberto Del Rio in a No DQ match. Del Rio got what could more accurately be described as 'polite applause' than a sustained pop, but at this point in his flat lining babyface run, he may well take that. Lots of props including a cane, chair and ladders, involvement from Colter and Ricardo too, Swagger eventually wins the match of the night so far by pinfall.</p><p>Final Thoughts: A decent nights entertainment, but, man, it really hurt having a Raw show run on the same night. I don't feel like I need to see Santino, Khali, Henry, Sheamus or Orton for a really long time. How come Dolph Ziggler wasn't on the card? Surely as the Blue brand champ he should have been in London for a second night.</p><p>WWE may have killed the cool factor to the Fandango thing in the U.S. with last week's Raw, but it was still red hot here, perhaps given our propensity to enjoy a chant and the music's natural fit into that. I didn't spend any money in the merch tents, but I noticed there were a lot of Sin Cara tees on sale (got to get rid somehow I guess) and that a programme would have set me back £15 ($23.)</p><p>My friend who accompanied me hadn't seen any wrestling since childhood. He enjoyed the show but his highlight by far was watching 16,000 do the Fandango. It'll grow old soon but for now it's really quite something to witness. Johnny Curtis must have been thrilled.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/281692">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/281692</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
