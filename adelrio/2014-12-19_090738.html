ACH!</p><p>One of the undisputedly most exciting athletes in the history of ROH, ACH is fueled by heart and motivation. And what's more motivational than the opportunity to take on an international champion with years of global success? 2014 was full of huge matches for ACH, including TV and World Title opportunities and a show-stealing performance in the year's CHAMPIONS VS. ALL STARS bout. Even if he didn't come out holding gold, ACH showed the world that he is a force in ROH - now and for the future.

Our biggest year ever is kicking off with some first time matches you aren't going to see anywhere else. Alberto El Patrón is an international superstar whose accolades (and championships) span the globe. Renowned for a hybrid style combining Lucha Libre, mixed martial arts, and other diverse fighting techniques, El Patrón comes equipped to take absolutely anyone to the limit. The entire ROH roster has been campaigning for the opportunity to face El Patrón in these matches. ROH Head Matchmaker Nigel McGuinness has taken every request into consideration and carefully evaluated the options. It's definitely not a simple task: virtually any combination could steal the show!</p><p>We already know that El Patrón will face "The Fallen Angel" Christopher Daniels on January 3rd in Nashville. And on January 30th in Dearborn, he faces the challenge of ACH! Today we can confirm Alberto El Patrón's opponent for January 31st when the ROH WINTER WARRIORS TOUR rolls into Dayton...</p><p>ALBERTO EL PATRÓN VS. RODERICK STRONG!</p><p>You can't come to Ring of Honor without wrestling "Mr. ROH"! Cocky and confident, Roderick Strong considers himself the most loyal, most iconic star in ROH. And when you look at his accomplishments, it's really difficult to argue against him! Roderick Strong might talk a lot of trash, but he also has the resume to back it up. It's often stated that Roderick Strong is the "gatekeeper" of ROH. He is the standard for excellence for anyone who hopes to compete in Ring of Honor - and he has been guarding the ranks for years. Strong, only the second Triple Crown Champion in ROH history, has made major claims that 2015 will be his year. He is motivated by a deep desire to prove that he the very best in the world, inside that ring. Having faced off with every major name in Ring of Honor history, from Bryan Danielson to Samoa Joe, Strong is no stranger to top level competition. With his eyes on winning gold in ROH in 2015, a win over the international superstar El Patrón, could put him in top contention to any championship.</p><p>The Mexican Aristocrat, El Patrón requested nothing but the very best from ROH matchmaker Nigel McGuinness. This match-up with Strong gives him not only one of the best today, but one of the best in Ring of Honor history! With a storied legacy of his own in Mexico, Japan and the US, can Alberto defeat “Mr. ROH” to add to it? The fans of Dayton will find out for sure.</p><p>Of course, El Patrón is world famous for his submission technique. He has seemingly limitless ways to trap an arm and make his opponents tap out. But while Roderick Strong might stand out for his speed and relentlessness, you can't discount his abilities as a submissions specialist himself. The Strong Hold remains one of the most inescapable, devastating techniques in Ring of Honor. Strong has used it to win match after match, time after time. As recently as FINAL BATTLE, he overcame Adam Page with the Strong Hold.<br> It is Roderick Strong’s take no prisoners, fast pace, aggressive style against Alberto’s dangerous array of submissions. Each man has something to prove to the other. Both men have something to prove the fans of Ring of Honor.</p><p>Two World class athletes collide in a dream match that you are only going to see in Ring of Honor, on January 31st. And you can be there too when the ROH WINTER WARRIORS TOUR stops in Dayton, Ohio! We will have more news about matches and other information right here at ROHwrestling.com.
