They sent us these highlights from the interview.</p><p>Mike Chiari: In addition to Prince Puma you've been interacting with Alberto El Patron a bit lately and you guys have had some interesting run-ins that lead many to believe that you could possibly lock horns in the near future. Alberto's hugely popular right now and he's the AAA heavyweight champion, so what's your interest level regarding a feud with Alberto and how do you think the crowd would react in terms of who they'd support?</p><p>First of all, Alberto is extremely talented and I did wrestle him a few times in WWE, but we never had enough time to put on the kind of match that I am looking forward to with him in Lucha Underground. It's very interesting the way he left WWE I think represents what pro-wrestlers should represent. He stood up for himself and the culture and that's been resonating with me and the fans of Lucha Underground. You can identify with somebody who stands up for who they are and what they believe in. He is also a very talented wrestler and I am looking forward to getting in the ring with him because I think that people aren't going to believe the type of match we are going to have. As far as how the fans will respond? I mean, Los Angeles is my hometown, and has been for Lucha Underground since day one, so I think a lot of fans that are going to see that and the hard work I have done, and chant "Mundo" until their faces melt. There are also a lot of fans that will respect Alberto and where he comes from and the talent he has in the ring and chant for him. The true winner is going to be the fans in the temple when Albert and I are in the ring.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0429/592855/john-morrison-on-how-alberto-del-rio-left-wwe/index-2.shtml">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0429/592855/john-morrison-on-how-alberto-del-rio-left-wwe/index-2.shtml</a></p>
