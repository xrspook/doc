To appreciate the invaluable impact made by the Money in the Bank contract since its inception, cash in these fun facts about the milestones made in the match’s wake:</p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li><p><strong>Raw is the preferred show by Money in the Bank Ladder Match winners looking to cash in their contract. It has occurred five times on the longest-running weekly episodic television series in U.S. history. Dolph Ziggler became the most recent to accomplish the feat when he executed his contract for an impromptu World Heavyweight Title Match against Alberto Del Rio on April 8.</strong></p></li><li><p>John Cena is the only Money in the Bank Ladder Match winner who did not successfully cash in a contract. Cena came up short in his WWE Title opportunity against CM Punk on Raw 1,000.</p></li><li><p>The Cenation leader has seen past WWE Title reigns end on two different occasions due to Money in the Bank contract cash-ins. No other former champion has had it happen more than once.</p></li><li><p><strong>Edge, CM Punk and Alberto Del Rio have more than just their Money in the Bank Ladder Match victories in common. They also represent the only Superstars who successfully cashed in a Money in the Bank contract to win a World Title and had another Superstar successfully cash in a Money in the Bank contract at their expense.</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><ul class="edui-filter-disc"><li><p>Cena and Rob Van Dam are the only Superstars who announced in advance that they intended to cash in their Money in the Bank contract on a future date. Cena stated he would cash in one week prior to his match against Punk, while Rob Van Dam scheduled his cash-in for ECW One Night Stand 2006. Daniel Bryan said he was cashing his contract in at WrestleMania XXVIII, but threw everyone a curveball at WWE Tables, Ladders & Chairs 2011 — most notably Big Show, who had just defeated Mark Henry for the World Heavyweight Title a mere 45 seconds earlier.</p></li><li><p>Edge waited 280 days to cash in the first Money in the Bank contract in WWE history, giving him the longest gap between when he won the contract and when he used it. The Rated-R Superstar used it for an impromptu WWE Title opportunity against John Cena at New Year’s Revolution 2006 after winning the contract at WrestleMania 21.</p></li><li><p>Kane is the first Money in the Bank Ladder Match winner to cash in on the same day that he won his World Title Match contract. The Big Red Monster successfully executed his contract against World Heavyweight Champion Rey Mysterio at Money in the Bank 2010. That also gives Kane the distinction of having the shortest gap between when he won the contract and when he used it.</p></li><li><p>June is the most popular month for Money in the Bank contract cash-ins, with three occurring in the sixth month of the year. CM Punk cashed in both of his contracts in June, as did Van Dam at ECW One Night Stand 2006.</p></li><li><p>Mr. Kennedy is the only Money in the Bank Ladder Match winner to lose his contract to another Superstar. Edge defeated Mr. Kennedy during Raw on May 7, 2007, to seize control of the contract, which he cashed in later that week to defeat The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Title.</p></li><li><p>The average wait a Money in the Bank Ladder Match winner waits to cash in his contract is 92.5 days. Ninety-two days is also how long CM Punk waited to cash in his second contract, having used it for a World Heavyweight Title Match against Jeff Hardy at Extreme Rules 2009.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/inside/money-in-the-bank-ladder-match-contract-fun-facts-26106952">http://www.wwe.com/inside/money-in-the-bank-ladder-match-contract-fun-facts-26106952</a></p><p></p><p></p>
