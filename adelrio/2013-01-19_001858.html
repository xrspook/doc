The crowd was still not convinced about Alberto being a face, as Big Show got most of the cheers. Good match with tables and chairs utilized. The ending saw Big Show getting ready to deliver a top-rope move, but Del Rio stood up and delivered a high enziguiri to Show's head, causing him to fall through a table. Alberto pinned and won.</p><p>After the match, Big Show got a big reaction as he left. Show acknowledged the cheers as he left up the ramp, then gave a wave and thumbs up to wrap up the show. I haven't been to a WWE show in many, many years, and this was a great night. Good job by all.</p><p>Most Popular:</p><p>(1) Orton (by far) (2) Sheamus (3) Kofi (4) Usos (5) Big Show</p><p>Most Heat:</p><p>(1) Barrett (2) Shield (3) 3MB (4) Ricardo Rodriguez (5) Del Rio</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_67966.shtml">http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena<em>Reports</em>10/article_67966.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN IN ANCHORAGE, ALASKA LIVE REPORT</strong></p><p>By Kristopher Nuttall on 2013-01-18 09:54:41</p><p>The show started promptly at 7:30 as advertised. It began with new recruits of the Alaska National Guard being sworn in, followed by the National Anthem. Both received nice pops.</p><p>In spite on not being Lillian Garcia, Tony Chimel received a decent pop when he can out to start the festivities.</p><p>The floor was jammed to capacity, the next round of seats were about 3/4th full, and the cheap seats were mostly empty. Now we know what mathematical formula WWE uses to decide whether to cancel a show or not.</p><p>A quick word about the fans. You could tell that it had been four years since the last WWE appearance because all (and I mean all) the fans wore their T-shirts from that time.</p><p>The main event was big show vs. Alberto Del Rio in a fans choose match. The choices were between a no DQ match or a best two out of three match. Fans were invited to vote via their smart phones. Let’s see, lots of families, a school night, and it was already after ten p.m.</p><p>The no DQ match had a lot of great plunder, and there were liberal uses of chairs and tables. Show lost when he crashed himself through a table for the second time. I have to give him a lot of credit, it would have been easy to just mail it in, but he worked hard.</p><p>All things considered, a very good evening. And as a reward for their efforts, our intrepid mat warriors will be rewarded with the opportunity to do this all over again on Friday night in Fairbanks, AK, where they will be met with temperatures of -22F.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74768">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=74768</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Second WWE House Show Report 01.17.13 - Anchorage, Alaska</strong></p><p>Posted by Jeremy Thomas on 01.18.2013</p><p>Some more results form the show...</p><p>Bell time was 7:30, my wife and I arrived around 6:30 and it was already filling up with people. Long lines for merch and food. I was planning on picking up a Wade Barrett and Alberto Del Rio shirt but there was only merch of the big stars (no Punk stuff though- sold out?). I settled on a $20 program.</p><p>Things kicked off a few minutes after 7:30. I don't think you realize how much of a wrestling nerd you are when you recognize Tony Chimel and Charles Robinson.</p><p>Match #8 Big Show vs Alberto Del Rio (w/ Ricardo Rodriguez.. but you already know that) in a audience-choose-the-stipulation-match-via-Twitter (they chose no DQ) for the World Heavyweight Championship Big Show out first, looked like he was slightly limping. He did the somber/angry no-reaction to the crowd heel bit. This match seemed slightly confusing, I realized how much the crowd plays into the match and how much WWE and maybe all of wrestling relies on the babyface-heel dynamic.</p><p>This was a crowd that was very pro-babyface, but most were cheering for Big Show. Throughout the match Ricardo and Del Rio seemed to try to play to the crowd in a babyface fashion (clapping hands, etc) which the crowd did follow along, but the crowd was probably 65% for Big Show.</p><p>Two tables were broken and one chair was used, and I think Ricardo used the belt on Big Show before Del Rio did his running back-of-the-head kick for the pin. Del Rio and Ricardo celebrated with the crowd for a bit as they went up the ramp and Big Show eventually slowly got up and was supported by the crowd. Show left the ring relatively quickly which confused the fans and some booed for no acknowledgement. Big Show eventually turned around to the crowd and pointed his finger upwards with a cheer from the crowd to end the show and send the fans home happy.</p><p>Announcer Tony Chimel again thanked the crowd. No return date was given.</p><p>BTW my wife really liked the show, she enjoyed it a lot compared to the moments she's seen Raw hahaha (yes, she saw the Mae Young/Hornswoggle New Years on Raw bit)</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/270374">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/270374</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
