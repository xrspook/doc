Ever since the announcement that El Patron would be headed to ROH, Head Matchmaker Nigel McGuinness has been inundated with phone calls, texts, and emails from every single athlete in the locker room. Each man wants a shot at El Patron, and there nearly limitless combinations of potential matchups for his ROH tenure. Over the next few days, ROHwrestling.com will be releasing information on who McGuinness has selected to face El Patron in his first ROH matches. But signed for Nashville on January 3rd...</p><p>ALBERTO EL PATRON VS. "THE FALLEN ANGEL" CHRISTOPHER DANIELS!</p><p>This is a first time ever match against a Ring of Honor original! Since returning to ROH, The Fallen Angel has been reinvigorated and ready to take on absolutely anyone from anywhere. The Addiction has made a huge impact on the ROH tag team division, but Daniels is also pursuing a singles career and having stellar matches against the best in Ring of Honor. Nigel McGuinness couldn't think of a better introduction to our elite roster than "The Fallen Angel" Christopher Daniels!</p><p>Daniels is one of the most well-rounded athletes in all of professional wrestling. He refuses to limit himself and that makes him an especially challenging opponent. Daniels can match anyone hold-for-hold, but he's not afraid to take to the sky either! This long tenured veteran has emerged as one of the most respected and successful professional wrestlers competing today, an athlete whose experience and savvy might be unmatched within the ROH locker room. According to Nigel McGuinness, all of these qualities made him the ideal "welcoming committee" for Alberto El Patron in Ring of Honor. On January 3rd, you will have the privilege of watching two of the best do what they love in front of the greatest fans on the planet!</p><p>Alberto El Patron's hybrid style combines MMA training with an eclectic mix of Mexican and American pro wrestling techniques. For years, El Patron has stood out as an exceptional talent against anyone who faced him. But any wrestling fan couldn't help but think: what if he had the chance to take on ANYONE in professional wrestling, unrestricted and unrestrained? Finally, that day has arrived. El Patron has been making waves since returning to competition in Mexico, recently securing the AAA Heavyweight Championship. Crowds around the world have exploded every time he makes his entrance.
