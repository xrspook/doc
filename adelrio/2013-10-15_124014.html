                            <h1>WWE Raw 2013-10-14 官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-10-15 12:40:14+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, raw, whc, daniel_bryan, 官方, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>Raw results: The Rhodes get golden, Orton traps Bryan, and Heyman goes to 'Hell'</strong></p><p>BY ANTHONY BENIGNO</p><p>October 14, 2013</p><p><strong>World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio def. Daniel Bryan via Count-out</strong></p><p></p><p>There’s almost nothing that can make Daniel Bryan stop competing and willingly abandon a match. Almost. Despite coming within a beard hair’s breadth of victory, the “Yes!” man willingly abdicated his bout with Alberto Del Rio when Randy Orton made his most brazen move yet and lured his fellow No. 1 contender away from combat.</p><p>That this even happened would have taken a truly atrocious act, since Bryan was hell bent from the get-go on making Del Rio pay for his earlier sneak attack. The ensuing contest wasn’t so much a wrestling match at first than a fistfight, and a perfectly-scouted one at that: Del Rio was well-prepared for all of Bryan’s moves and refused to yield the advantage. And yet, Bryan eventually did just that, pummeling Del Rio with a missile dropkick … until, that is, Randy Orton appeared on the TitanTron entering the trainer’s room, evidently attempting to threaten Brie Bella.</p><p>Bryan quickly abandoned the match and ran to his fiancée’s aide, only to be attacked from behind and thrown headfirst into the trainer’s tub by Orton. The chivalry not only cost him his health, but the bout, via Count-out, to Del Rio.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-10-14/wwe-raw-results-26155960/page-10">http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-10-14/wwe-raw-results-26155960/page-10</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Raw results: The Rhodes get golden, Orton traps Bryan, and Heyman goes to 'Hell'</strong></p><p>BY ANTHONY BENIGNO</p><p>October 14, 2013</p><p><strong>Triple H & Stephanie McMahon addressed Big Show’s attack</strong></p><p></p><p>Mr. McMahon once famously warned Superstars not to “cross the Boss,” and it would appear that The Chairman’s mentality has been passed down in full to his daughter and son-in-law. Following Big Show’s firing by Stephanie and subsequent knockout of COO Triple H, “The Authority” not only pressed charges but vowed to reclaim anything of value the giant calls his own. Triple H in particular promised to make his detractors "grovel" at his feet, to say nothing of anyone who chanted the word "YES!" after Big Show had KO'ed him.</p><p>As if on cue, Daniel Bryan arrived to fan the flames of his celebration over the flattened COO the previous week by leading a massive "YES!" chant, but he was quickly attacked from behind by Alberto Del Rio. Sensing a business opportunity of sorts, Stephanie capitalized by scheduling Bryan to face “Mexico’s Greatest Export” later in the evenin while Triple H chanted "YES!" Call it a seal of approval.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-10-14/wwe-raw-results-26155960/page-5">http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-10-14/wwe-raw-results-26155960/page-5</a></p>
