Pretty much sold out tonight. Much better than the abysmal 1,000 or so who attended the post-Labor Day Smackdown taping. 1/2 of the arena was tarped off for that one.<br><br>Michael Cole, Booker T and Josh Matthews on commentary. Lilian Garcia is the ring announcer.<br><br>Lilian introduced World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, who cut a brief promo to start the show. Sheamus said he loves to fight (a promo straight out of Finlay's playbook) so when Daniel Bryan asked for a rematch he simply answered "YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!" [Cue loud "YES!" chants from the Toledo crowd.] Out came Daniel Bryan. Sheamus continued "YESing" through Bryan's entrance. Doesn't look like we're getting the main event that was advertised last night.<br><br>1. Sheamus and Daniel Bryan fought to an apparent no-contest. Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez interfered to cause the finish. Ricardo hit a (from my vantage-point) picture-perfect cross body on Sheamus followed by a kick from ADR. Bryan then locked Sheamus in the Yes! Lock before being pulled off by Scott Armstrong and Chad Patton. Daniel Bryan then argued with ADR and Rich Rod, almost coming to blows.<br><br>Backstage, the WWE medical staff evaluated Sheamus.<br><br>Eve was involved in a backstage segment with Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio. Nothing notable here.<br><br>Ricardo Rodriguez introduced Alberto Del Rio from the stage; ADR drove out in a fancy car. He is sitting in on commentary for the main event.<br><br>8. Sheamus defeated Daniel Bryan to retain the World Hvt. Championship. Sheamus threw Bryan into ADR, knocking him through the ropes. While Sheamus was distracted by ADR and Rich Rod trying to regain their composure, Bryan snuck up to the top rope. He leapt into a Brogue kick and Sheamus covered him for the victory.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/236444">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/236444</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>NoDQ.com > WWE > WWE Smackdown Taping Results for 5/4/12</strong><br><br>Posted by Steve Carrier on 05/01/2012 at 08:24 PM<br><br>Tonight WWE is taping Smackdown from live from Toledo, Ohio.
