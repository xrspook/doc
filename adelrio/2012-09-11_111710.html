Sheamus tells a few jokes and then he says that isn’t his real last name. Otunga wants to get things all serious. Otunga asks Sheamus about what happened on September 3rd. Sheamus says that if he had the opportunity to do it again, he would do it.</p><p>Sheamus is asked about Chad Patton. Otunga shows Sheamus a photo of a Brogue Kick to Chad. Otunga asks Sheamus about Daniel Bryan and Sheamus yeses. We see a photo from most of the match between Sheamus and Bryan at Wrestlemania.</p><p>Otunga asks Sheamus about the pain that Patton is suffering or the psychological damage to Daniel Bryan. Otunga asks Sheamus if he understands that the Brogue Kick is a lethal weapon. Sheamus says that the Brogue Kick doesn’t discriminate against anyone. Sheamus kicks the camera.</p><p>Match Number Eight: Sheamus versus David Otunga</p><p>Otunga charges after Sheamus and he kicks him and then connects with a series of forearms and kicks. Otunga slaps Sheamus but Sheamus with a shoulder tackle and knees to Otunga that send him to the apron. Sheamus with forearms to the chest with Otunga on the apron. Sheamus with the uranage back breaker and then he looks around and he applies the Cloverleaf and Otunga taps out.</p><p>Winner: Sheamus</p><p>After the match, Sheamus leaves the ring and then he comes back to the ring and he looks around the fans want a Brogue Kick. Sheamus signals for the Brogue Kick and he connects and sends Otunga to the mat in a heap.</p><p>AJ Lee comes out and says that Sheamus has defied authority.</p><p>Booker T interrupts, having no authority on Raw. He tells AJ that he doesn’t know what AJ is going to say, but this is World Championship business. He tells Sheamus that he shouldn’t be using the Brogue Kick in light of his internal investigation. This won’t look good for Sheamus. Booker tells Sheamus that if he chooses to use the Brogue Kick in any situation before his internal investigation is completed, he will be stripped of the World Title.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=71823">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=71823</a></p>
