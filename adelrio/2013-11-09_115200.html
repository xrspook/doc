                            <h1>WWE Smackdown 2013-11-08 非官方战报</h1><p>作者: xrspook</p><p>日期: 2013-11-09 11:52:00+08:00</p><p>分类: 点点文本</p><p>标签: alberto_del_rio, wwe, 2013, smackdown, john_cena, vickie_guerrero, the_great_khali, whc, 战报</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: DEL RIO AND CENA FACE MONSTERS; ROWAN AND HARPER WILL HAVE TO GET THEIR WRESTLING SHOES READY; TOTAL DIVAS IS BACK; AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Richard Trionfo on 2013-11-08 22:00:49</p><p>Tonight, we begin with a look at what the Wyatt Family has done to members of the WWE roster, including the most recent victims, CM Punk and Daniel Bryan.</p><p>We are in Charlotte, North Carolina and your announcers are Michael ‘Bobcat’ Cole and John ‘How Will Zeb do next week in Europe’ Layfield.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio walks in the back as we go to commercial.</p><p>We are back and Alberto is on his way to the ring with his giant Mexican flag.</p><p>Alberto says that he is more than a world class athlete. He is a Mexican world class athlete. That makes him better to the rest of the world. That makes him better than any of you gringos. He says that he should still be the World Heavyweight Champion, but the title was stolen from him by John Cena.</p><p>Alberto says that the people cheer for John because they don’t know what is good for them. He says that they have no brains. People should see John for what he is. He is a thief. John is walking around with something he does not deserve.</p><p>The Gringos don’t know this, but at Hell in a Cell, he was sick. He had a fever, his knee, elbow, and neck were hurt. He begged the doctors to let him compete that night. Any of you lazy Americans would have called in sick that day. Not Alberto Del Rio. He is Mexican and he has pride.</p><p>After his rematch against John Cena, he will tell every Gringo . . . The Champ is Here!!!</p><p>John Cena’s music plays and he makes his way to the ring to provide a rebuttal.</p><p>John says normally he is excited to come here because he knows that he is ready to fight. Tonight is different because we heard that Alberto Del Rio was sick. We have done nothing for him. John tells Michael to get a gift for Alberto. A fruit basket and a card that plays music. The card will say ‘Dear friend Alberto, sorry you weren’t feeling so well, sorry I whipped your butt at Hell in a Cell, sorry you aren’t World Champion, get well soon. Your friend John Cena. P.S. watch the JBL and Cole show’.</p><p>Alberto tells John that this is not a joke and John is acting like a stupid little kid. He tells John to leave his show right now.</p><p>John tells Alberto to make him. The World Champion is two feet away from him and he is not calling in sick or backing down. Why not give Alberto his rematch tonight?</p><p>Alberto says that is exactly why he is here. He wants a referee to come out right now and he wants a doctor too because he will be sending John to the hospital. He will take back his title and he is going to break Cena’s arm.</p><p>Vickie Guerrero comes out and Excuse Mes her way onto the stage. She says that she is in charge and the World Title Match will not take place tonight. However, Alberto Del Rio will face John Cena for the World Title at Survivor Series. That is what is best for business.</p><p>John mentions that Vickie is out here and she is sick too because she has a chronic case of diarrhea of the mouth. Vickie has done two things that are best for business. The first was when she was fired and the other is when she shuts the hell up.</p><p>Alberto says that he thought he would never say this, but Little Juanito is right.</p><p>Vickie excuse mes and she says that she has picked out their opponents for tonight. Later, John Cena will be facing the Monster . . . Ryback. She excuse mes and tells Alberto that since he is just as disrespectful and offensive as John Cena, Alberto will face this monster . . . right now.</p><p>The music for the Great Khali plays and he makes his way to the ring.</p><p><strong>Match Number Four: Alberto Del Rio versus Great Khali</strong></p><p>They lock up and Khali pushes Del Rio away. Del Rio with a kick and punches followed by more kicks. Khali with a clothesline to the top of the head and then he connects with elbows in the corner. Khali with a chop. Khali puts Del Rio on the turnbuckles and he chops Del Rio and Alberto falls to the floor.</p><p>Khali goes to the floor and he gives Del Rio a head butt. Khali Irish whips Del Rio into the ringside barrier. Khali sends Del Rio back into the ring but Del Rio drops the arm on the top rope. Del Rio with a super kick and he kicks Khali in the left arm. Del Rio wraps the arm in the ropes and Del Rio releases the hold just in time.</p><p>Del Rio with a kick to the shoulder and he slams the arm into the mat. Del Rio with a key lock but Khali with knees to the head. Del Rio with a kick to Khali and then he goes to the turnbuckles. Del Rio is met with a boot from Khali and both men are down. Khali with an elbow to a charging Del Rio. Khali with a kick to the head and a punch.</p><p>Del Rio falls to the floor. Khali goes to the floor and he sends Del Rio back in. Khali with a chop and then he puts Del Rio on the turnbuckles again but Del Rio with a cross arm breaker in the ropes but Khali drops Del Rio on the apron.</p><p>Khali pushes Del Rio away but Del Rio with a step up enzuigiri to the arm and Del Rio floats over and he applies the cross arm breaker and Khali taps out.</p><p>Winner: Alberto Del Rio</p><p>After the match, Alberto Del Rio attacks Cena and he works on the injured arm. Del Rio pulls Cena to the ring post and he wrings the injured arm into the ring post and then Del Rio with a super kick to the injured arm.</p><p>Cena with punches and kicks to Del Rio when Alberto tries to get back into the ring.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://pwinsider.com/article/81446/wwe-smackdown-report-del-rio-and-cena-face-monsters-rowan-and-harper-will-have-to-get-their-wrestling-shoes-ready-total-divas-is-back-and-more.html?p=1">http://pwinsider.com/article/81446/wwe-smackdown-report-del-rio-and-cena-face-monsters-rowan-and-harper-will-have-to-get-their-wrestling-shoes-ready-total-divas-is-back-and-more.html?p=1</a></p><p></p><p>更多地图事件请移步：<a href="http://images.xlanda.net/yark/map/destiny-map-2013-gm.html">MAP OF DESTINY 2013</a></p>
