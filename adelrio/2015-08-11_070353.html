FORMER SIN CARA, ALBERTO VS. CAGE AND MORE</strong></p><p>By Mike Johnson on 2015-08-09 22:00:00</p><p>Welcome to PWInsider.com's live, ongoing coverage of AAA Triplemania 2015 from Mexico City.</p><p>The English announcers for the PPV are Hugo Savinovich and Matt Striker. They had a 30 minute pre-game show that was an easy way for new viewers to understand the stories for the main events.</p><p>The PPV went on the air and they introduced the announcers as well as Marisella Pena, who was shown holding the urn that is said to contain the ashes of AAA founder Antonio Pena. They aired a video feature on the company's history before going into a fancy pyro show set to the Mission Impossible theme.</p><p><strong>Hair vs. Hair: AAA Mega Champion Alberto el Patron vs. Brian Cage</strong></p><p>Alberto worked him over with punches in the corner. Alberto nailed Cage with a series of chairs to the head and the gut. Alberto nailed a tope to the outside. Cage took control and used the chair on Alberto. Alberto was worked over on the floor and busted open.</p><p>Cage brought a cookie sheet into the ring and and drilled Alberto with it across the back several times. Cage nailed a standing moonsault press for a two count. He worked over Alberto and sent him into the corner but missed when El Patron avoided the charge. Cage nailed his shoulder into the corner. El Patron nailed a swinging neckbreaker but Cage cut him off.</p><p>El Hijo del Fantasma, Cage's second, jumped in the ring and worked over Alberto. Cage set up and nailed a superplex. Fantasma nailed a splash. Fenix, who was seconding Alberto, hit the ring for the save and nailed a springboard dive on Fantasma to the floor. Cage grabbed Fenix and powerbombed him into the ringpost. Fantasma suplexed him on the ramp.</p><p>Cage continued to work over Alberto with a series of shoulderblocks in the corner. El Patron locked on the cross armbreaker while he was outside the ring, so it had to be broken up but it took some of the fight out of Cage. Patron finally fired back but Cage overpowered him and beat Alberto into the buckles over and over. Cage nailed him with a clothesline.</p><p>Cage posed on the ropes and went for a moonsault but el Patron rolled out of the way. Alberto came to life with clotheslines and a lungblower for a two count. He went for the leaping enziguiri but missed, only to be nailed with a discus lariat by Cage.</p><p>Cage brought a table into the ring. The referee helped him set it up, so that may have been a heel turn tease Hugo acted like it was. Cage was limping after the moonsault. He set up the table in the corner, then went for a second table, placing that in the ring. Cage set up Alberto for a move but Alberto fought him off. Cage held onto the ropes but Alberto nailed a double stomp off the ropes. He went for the rolling armbar but was sent off into the table in the corner, shattering it.</p><p>Cage covered Patron, who kicked up at the last second. Alberto drilled him with a series of moves and covered Cage but the referee took forever and was obviously going heel. He challenged Patron and slapped him. Alberto nailed a titowhirl backbreaker on the referee. Cage nailed Alberto and drilled him. El Patron came back to nail a DDT but obviously, there was no referee.</p><p>Patron went for a top rope rana through a table but was lowblowed. Cage powerbombed him through the table. He covered el Patron as the tecnico referee ran out and counted but Alberto kicked out at two. Cage drilled Alberto over and over with chairs to the head Alberto lowblowed him and sent him into a chair in the corner. He locked on the cross armbreaker and got the submission.</p><p>Your winner and still AAA Megachampion, Alberto el Patron!</p><p>Easily the best thing on the show in terms of wrestling. They told a really good story and it was a fun brawl. They seemed to finally get the production issues fixed with this bout.</p><p>Alberto took the mic and said it was a great evening and that they did it. He said Cage tried to embarrass him, but he got him. Cage stood there like a man and allowed them to shave his head.</p><p>Patron laid out Cage and placed him under a Mexican flag as revenge for Cage doing it to Alberto and placing the U.S. flag on Alberto.</p><p>Overall, the majority of the show was a letdown as the early bouts weren't very good when you take some of the cool dives out of the equation. Then, you had so many technical and production issues that totally took you out of the moment. The top matches were really good but not enough to save the overall show especially when you lose whatever the ending was. When you are paying $30 in today's landscape, you deserve better than what was presented here. I love the idea of these international shows being aired in the United States more than I can say but if the shows can't be watched and enjoyed because of outside factors, it's just not worth doing. Hopefully they get it right in October.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=95763">http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=95763</a></p>
