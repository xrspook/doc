It seemed like they were content to work a regular match and stick to the ring. But, their excursion from the ring added a lot as they built up to bigger and bigger spots, had a lot of back-and-forth and teased the finish well for the final five or six minutes. Del Rio's mid-match mic rant was a nice touch and I'd like to see him do that more. It suits his character well. The finish itself was somewhat obvious (that or Sheamus getting involved) and would have worked better in a regular match, not as the finish to a stipulations match like this where it ending cleanly would have been nice. Another time, another place, I guess.</p><p>Rating: 8.0 out of 10</p><p>Segment of the Night: The Falls Count Anywhere Match</p><p>Trash Segment of the Night: Kaitlyn vs. Eve</p><p>Final Analysis: A solid show, but without any really strong segment to anchor things like the last few weeks. It was a much more even show without any high highs or low lows. I did like the comedy of Kane and Daniel Bryan, and Punk's walk out. The Miz taking Jerry Lawler's place on commentary gave the evening a different flavor -- a much-needed change up. Like almost every other three-hour Raw, though, this episode felt too long and, by the end, I was just waiting out the clock to a degree, despite Del Rio and Cena putting on a good match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/253474">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/253474</a></p>
