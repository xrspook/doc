Then we see how Sheamus got revenge by damaging Alberto Del Rio’s car. Then we see Booker T’s announcement last week that Alberto Del Rio was removed from the World Title Match at SummerSlam.</p><p>We are live on tape from Austin, Texas and your announcers are Michael ‘I asked Jim Ross to attend tonight, but he said no’ Cole and Josh ‘Chris Simms’ Mathews.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio comes to the ring with Ricardo Rodriguez and this time he is walking to the ring instead of worrying about Sheamus stealing another car.</p><p>Alberto says that he wants his World Title match back right now.

He tells Alberto that his breath smells like dog poop.</p><p>Alberto asks Jericho what he wants.</p><p>Chris says that since Alberto is not getting a title match at SummerSlam, after he beats Dolph Ziggler at SummerSlam, he can take Alberto’s spot in the match against Sheamus and become the new World Champion.</p><p>Alberto wants to know if Jericho is crazy. He saw a peasant steal his car. He is not going to let another steal his title match.</p><p>Chris and Alberto argue and Booker decides to jump in. Booker says that everyone knows that his word was laid down. Sheamus is not competing at SummerSlam so we can have a main event tonight.
