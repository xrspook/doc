One random thing is that the announcers' entrances were interesting. JBL got a huge pop while Michael Cole got boos/apathy.</p><p>The Highlight Reel opened the show. Chris Jericho started by saying that The Miz was injured on Raw in the Antonio Cesaro attack and that is why ADR is the new Highlight Reel guest. They replayed the footage of the Cesaro attack. Ricardo Rodriguez came out to take over the introduction for Del Rio. Del Rio was over huge, especially with my niece who had never shown an interest before.</p><p>Jericho brought up his period of wrestling in Mexico and said that he will win the Elimination Chamber and face Del Rio. After a really funny back and forth in Spanish involving Del Rio, Jericho, and Rodriguez, Dolph Ziggler's music hit and Jericho came up with a bunch of new names for Big E.</p><p>Ziggler promised to cash in the MITB briefcase sometime between now and WrestleMania. Del Rio challenged Ziggler to a match on the spot. After a "Sí" chant, Ziggler accepted.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio (w/Ricardo Rodriguez) beat Dolph Ziggler (w/AJ, Big E Langston) in a non-title match. The match started slow but worked up to a great pace and the fans stayed with it. Late in the match, Del Rio called for the Cross Arm Breaker. AJ distracted the ref for Big E to hit Del Rio with a punch. Ricardo tried to intimidate Big E and was chased off. Del Rio eventually applied the Cross Armbreaker for the submission win in a long match. It was described as a pay-per-view quality match.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/273353">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/273353</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>SPOILERS WWE Main Event Results For This Wednesday</strong></p><p>Thanks to WrestlingINC.com reader Parker for sending in these results from tonight's SmackDown taping at the Verizon Arena in Little Rock, AR:</p><p>There was a pretty good crowd, as opposed to the last time. The upper section seats sold out for the first time in a couple of years.</p><p>Chris Jericho came out for The Highlight Reel. His guest was Alberto Del Rio. Dolph Ziggler then came out and said that he would cash in Money In The Bank before WrestleMania. Del Rio then challenged Ziggler, which led to our first match.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio vs. Dolph Ziggler is up first. This match was a real battle. Big E tried to interfere, but it wasn't enough and Del Rio submitted Ziggler with the cross arm breaker.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0212/560336/spoilers-wwe-main-event/">http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0212/560336/spoilers-wwe-main-event/</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Spoilers WWE Main Event & Saturday Morning Slam Tapings Results</strong></p><p>Submitted by Michael Bluth on February 12, 2013 - 9:37pm</p><p>WWE taped matches for this week's Main Event & an upcoming episode of Saturday Morning Slam on Tuesday night from the Verizon Arena in Little Rock, Arkansas. Here are the results:</p><p>Chris Jericho hosted the Highlight Reel. His guest was supposed to be The Miz, but he announced The Miz was injured by Antonio Cesaro on RAW, so his new guest is Alberto Del Rio. Chris Jericho told Del Rio that he's going to win the Elimination Chamber match this Sunday and wrestle him for the World Heavyweight title at WrestleMania. As the two were arguing back and forth, Dolph Ziggler came out with AJ Lee and Big E. Langston. Ziggler promised to cash his Money in the Bank briefcase by WrestleMania 29. Del Rio challenged Ziggler and he accepted.</p><p>Alberto Del Rio defeated Dolph Ziggler by submission with his cross armbreaker.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://rajah.com/node/32206">http://rajah.com/node/32206</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Main Event Spoilers – 2/13/13</strong></p><p>Posted on Feb 12 2013 - 9:55pm by MMiddleton</p><p>WWE will tape this week's episode of WWE Main Event from the Verizon Arena in Little Rock, Arkansas.
