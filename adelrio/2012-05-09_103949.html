Lawler said that its easy to forget that just because they team up, that doesn't make them friends.<br><br>Good tag match.

Chris Jericho livened this one up quite a bit with his posturing and taunting of Sheamus. It makes me want to see Jericho do more tag team wrestling again, perhaps with a partner more complementary than the Big Show. He and Del Rio functioned well as a team -- they both shout out their catchphrases before doing moves, for example. I expected this match to end in a similar way to Orton's teaming with the Big Show on Friday against Kane and Cody Rhodes, but Sheamus hitting Orton with the Brogue Kick accidentally and eating a Codebreaker was a nice twist. This was just an entertaining and engrossing match where everything worked well. The post-match RKO was obvious and, yet, satisfying.<br><br>Backstage, the brawl in John Laurinaitis's office led to altering the World Heavyweight Championship match to a Fatal Fourway involving all four of the men from the tag match. A logical extension of the match and a potentially great match. Also, how awesome is it that Daniel Bryan and Chris Jericho basically traded places post-Extreme Rules?<br><br>Rating: 8.5 out of 10</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/237240">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/237240</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Raw Deal May 7: Good Guys Learn Don't Cross the Boss</strong><br><br>By John Canton (Featured Columnist) on May 8, 2012 <br><br>Tag match is next at the top of hour two: Orton & Sheamus vs. Jericho & Del Rio.<br><br>(Commercial)<br><br>They plugged Santino's Foreign Exchange show on WWE's YouTube channel. It's usually pretty funny from what I've seen.<br><br>In the ring, Ricardo Rodriguez gave a big introduction for Alberto Del Rio, who came out in a 2012 Ferrari worth $377,000 according to Cole. They mentioned that it would be Sheamus vs. Del Rio for the World Title at Over the Limit. I don't think anybody believes Del Rio will win, nor should they.<br><br>Del Rio got moved to SmackDown. No legitimate reason was given for it, but I think it was a numbers thing in that SmackDown needed more top of the line heels. I would have preferred Ziggler in the spot personally. Chris Jericho made his entrance. Big pop for Randy Orton. The World Champ, Sheamus came out last to a good ovation as well.<br><br>Sheamus & Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho & Alberto Del Rio w/Ricardo Rodriguez<br><br>There are no current feuds for Orton and Jericho so perhaps that could get started here. The faces had control early. Sheamus destroyed Jericho with ten punches while he was between the ropes. That's a good spot that generates a good reaction. Jericho avoided a powerslam by shoving Sheamus into the ring post. Del Rio kicked Sheamus in the injured left arm while he was out on the floor. The left shoulder of Sheamus is still bandaged to sell his recent beatings at the hands of Daniel Bryan. I love when injuries are sold for longer than a week. Three minutes into the match we head to break for the vintage floor-to-commercial spot.<br><br>(Commercial)<br><br>Back to the action, Jericho was in control of Sheamus for about 30 seconds. Sheamus ended up getting the hot tag to Orton while Jericho tagged out to Del Rio. Orton hit a powerslam on Jericho while Rodriguez distracted the ref to allow Del Rio to hit an enziguiri to Orton for a count of two. The heels worked over Orton for a bit. Orton hit a dropkick on Jericho. Cole said you don't see Orton throw many of them. What? He has one of the best dropkicks and does them all the time.<br><br>Jericho slowed Orton down to prevent the tag. He gave him a reverse chinlock: "ASK HIM!" Orton rolled him up for two. Jericho gave Orton an enziguiri. Del Rio tagged in and dropped Orton's left arm onto his own knees. He yelled out "destiny" as he tried to put on the Cross Armbreaker. I guess he still says "destiny" then? Okay. Hot tag to Sheamus while Del Rio brought in Jericho. Sheamus hit a high knee to Jericho. Then he powered out of the Walls of Jericho and hit the Irish Curse backbreaker. Del Rio ran in, so Orton gave him a RKO. Sheamus went for the Brogue Kick but Jericho moved out of the way. The Brogue Kick hit Orton in the face. Sheamus was stunned. Jericho ended up hitting the Codebreaker on Sheamus. He pinned Sheamus for the win after 13 minutes.<br><br>Winners: Chris Jericho and Alberto Del Rio<br><br>After the match, Jericho grabbed the World Title. He said he should be the champion. The heels celebrated as they left. Sheamus tried to help Orton up. Orton didn't want it. He then hit Sheamus with a RKO, which left the World Champion out on the mat.<br><br>Analysis: ***1/2 This was your typical very good middle of the show tag match that allowed all four guys to get a chance to shine. They're all big names who have established signature moves that the crowd popped for. It's a formulaic tag match that always works. No complaints here. We need more of these on a regular basis. The booking decision is interesting because now it seems as though we could get a Fatal Fourway at Over the Limit rather than the already announced Sheamus/Del Rio match.<br><br>Later tonight, an update on Triple H's condition and the future of Brock Lesnar.<br><br>Also, later is CM Punk vs. Lord Tensai.<br><br>(Commercial)<br><br>Backstage, John Laurinaitis was with Eve. She said she'd go talk to Big Show.<br><br>All of a sudden, Laurinaitis was joined by Jericho, Del Rio and Orton. All of them wanted a title shot against Sheamus. They started brawling. Suddenly, Sheamus showed up and all four guys were brawling. The faces took care of the heels. Sheamus got in Orton's face because they each hit the other guy with their finisher. Sheamus: "You bring it fella!" Laurinaitis announced the World Title match will now be a Fatal Fourway between Sheamus, Alberto Del Rio, Chris Jericho & Randy Orton. My guess was right. Cool. It will be better this way.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1176702-wwe-raw-deal-for-may-7-good-guys-learn-dont-cross-the-boss">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1176702-wwe-raw-deal-for-may-7-good-guys-learn-dont-cross-the-boss</a><br></p>
