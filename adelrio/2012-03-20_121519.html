WWE is still protecting Del Rio so it sounds like he's not 100% yet.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://nodq.com/wwe/334165012.shtml">http://nodq.com/wwe/334165012.shtml</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE News: Alberto Del Rio Works A Match At Madison Square Garden, Zack Ryder To Hold A Rally Before RAW</strong><br><br>Posted by Joseph Lee on 03.19.2012<br><br>Del Rio beat Mason Ryan...<br><br>-Alberto Del Rio worked a match at a house show in Madison Square Garden this week. He beat Mason Ryan at the event in a quick bout. It's being speculated that Del Rio isn't recovered from his injury.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/229871">http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/229871</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE Rumors: The Rock, John Cena, CM Punk and Monday's Top WWE News</strong>By Adam Wells (Featured Columnist) on March 19, 2012<br><br>ALBERTO DEL RIO RETURNS TO ACTION<br><br>After working a few angles at house shows over the past few weeks, Alberto Del Rio returned to the ring against Mason Ryan during Sunday's show in Madison Square Garden. He defeated Mason Ryan in a short match.<br><br>Question on Everybody's Mind: What is Del Rio's WrestleMania status?<br><br>Our Take: The fact that he is wrestling again is a good sign. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like he is still able to do a lot in the ring. He could be relegated to a backstage vignette, unless he gets thrown into the 12-man tag match where he can be hidden.<br><br>Hype Meter: 3 out of 5 Terrible Towels<br><br>After WrestleMania, Del Rio is going to be one of the most important stars on the roster. All the top stars that are back now—Rock, Undertaker, Triple H and Shawn Michaels—will be gone. It will be incumbent upon the creative team to get others over.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1110077-wwe-rumors-the-rock-john-cena-cm-punk-and-mondays-top-wwe-news">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1110077-wwe-rumors-the-rock-john-cena-cm-punk-and-mondays-top-wwe-news</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WWE News: Latest on the Health of WWE Star Alberto Del Rio</strong><br><br>By Drake Oz (Featured Columnist) on March 19, 2012<br><br>Alberto Del Rio spent most of 2011 in the WWE Championship picture, but unfortunately for him, he’s spent the past three months on the sidelines.<br><br>The former WWE Champion suffered a torn groin last December, and his only appearance on WWE TV since then came at last month’s Elimination Chamber pay-per-view. Although Del Rio figured to play a big part at WrestleMania, he’s still yet to find a spot on the show.<br><br>So, why is that? Well, we have the latest on the current health of Del Rio.<br><br>From WrestleNewz.com: "Alberto Del Rio was in action at MSG yesterday and beat Mason Ryan in a quick match. WWE is still protecting Del Rio so it sounds like he’s not 100% yet."<br><br>All indications seem to be that ADR isn’t ready to return to the ring.<br><br>When you combine Del Rio’s short house show match with his lack of TV appearances since Elimination Chamber, you have to think the groin injury is still bothering him, even if it is just slightly.<br><br>Just how much it’s bothering him, however, will determine the WWE’s plans for him going forward.<br><br>Given that Del Rio has already voiced his support for John Laurinaitis, I would think that there are still plans to put him on Team Laurinaitis after WrestleMania. After all, this match needs some more star power, and whether your like him or not, Del Rio would certainly give it that.<br><br>Plus, we have to realize that, even if Del Rio isn’t 100 percent healthy, this is a 12-man tag team match we’re talking about here. Not some 20-minute singles match.<br><br>Del Rio can still participate in the match and decrease his risk of injury if he only appears for a couple of minutes or so. With five teammates, ADR could have a short showing in the bout just to get him on the card (and keep him relevant), or he can be a member of Team Long but never get tagged in and still be on the winning team.<br><br>There are a lot of options for Del Rio here, and plenty of them involve him actually participating in the match at WrestleMania, even if it’s not by throwing punches or hitting suplexes.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1111057-wwe-news-latest-on-the-health-of-wwe-star-alberto-del-rio">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1111057-wwe-news-latest-on-the-health-of-wwe-star-alberto-del-rio</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>WrestleMania 28: 10 Wrestlers Who Should Be on Team Laurinaitis</strong><br><br>By Graham 'GSM' Matthews (Featured Columnist) on March 19, 2012<br><br>Alberto Del Rio<br><br>Based upon the events that occurred at Elimination Chamber last month, Alberto Del Rio is an obvious choice for Team Laurinaitis. His health is the only thing holding him back, as it's still questionable at this point whether he's fully recovered from the groin injury he sustained at the conclusion of 2011.<br><br>At WrestleMania 27, Del Rio walked in as the 2011 Royal Rumble winner and challenged Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship. A year later, any momentum he once had is now drained after losing his WWE Championship to CM Punk at Survivor Series in November.<br><br>While the Mexican aristocrat may have grown stale over the last year, there's no denying that he deserves a spot on the card given his main event status. With rumors circulating that Del Rio will be inducting his uncle Mil Mascaras into the WWE Hall of Fame the night before the event, leaving him off the card would certainly be a shocking move.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1109308-wrestlemania-28-10-wrestlers-who-should-be-on-team-laurinaitis/page/2">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1109308-wrestlemania-28-10-wrestlers-who-should-be-on-team-laurinaitis/page/2</a> <br></p>
