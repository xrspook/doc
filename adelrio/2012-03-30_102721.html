The 3,200-square-foot pediatric hematology-oncology clinic is set to open later this spring in Miami.<br><br>"When we can lend anything to the community, then it's a really great night," said Triple H.<br><br>Hosted by Timbaland and Miami philanthropist Stuart Miller, the benefit showcases works from local artists like Miguel Paredes and Art Rotondo, as well as fashion by celebrity designer Charlie Lapson. For the very first time, the event features a fashion show with WWE Divas Alicia Fox, Kelly Kelly, Eve and The Bellas modeling clothes from top designers in the Miami area. Many fashion and art pieces are available for silent and live auction throughout the evening.<br><br>"It's an amazing opportunity for the Superstars and Divas to be here. I couldn't be more honored to be the WWE.com red carpet hostess of the event," Natalya said. "To use WWE as a platform to help kids with cancer is so rewarding. We put smiles on people's faces."<br><br><strong>Superstars seemed eager to get in on the bidding as the party kicked off, with Kofi Kingston, Cody Rhodes and Alberto Del Rio saying they planned to participate in the auction.</strong><br><br>"I brought my wallet and I'm ready to roll," said Rhodes, who added that he just bought a new place and needs art for it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>As for impressions on who the sharpest-dressed Superstar is? Natalya noted that Del Rio is "always dressed to kill."</strong><br><br>Kingston, on the other hand, said his wife had to convince him not to wear spandex to the party, but did get a compliment from Natalya on how nice he looks in his suit.<br><br>One WWE legend didn't feel quite at home embracing his fashionable side.<br><br>"I'm going to concentrate on all the good we are doing tonight," said Mick Foley, admitting that he feels uncomfortable "stylistically" at red carpet events like this.<br><br>Members of the WWE Universe also are getting involved in the auction from afar, as they bid online on WWE-themed works of art, with net proceeds from the online auction benefiting children's oncology care at the Center.
