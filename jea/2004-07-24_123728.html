But that one single one was a personage who the Colombian actor Jorge Enrique Abello, developed in one of the best moments of his professional and also personal life. Jorge arrived at the indicated place and in the right moment, so that he touched this opportunity to him that brought all the happiness to him of the world. Now after to have carried out another soap opera, call, "La costeña and cachaco", returns to sets of recording, but this time, will not be in its country of origin; Jorge Enrique begins his true internationalization. And he is that although knows it in many countries, he cannot say that is an international actor because it is not but until now that works outside Colombia. </P><P>For surprise of many and mainly of RCN Television, - his until now televising house -, Jorge Enrique will be the protagonist in the "Anita soap opera, you do not crack," a Co-production of Telemundo and RTI Miami. A humorous history that will please much by the diverse situations that will present/display. Anita is Ivonne Montero, who will nothing else dispute to the love of Jorge Enrique and nothing less than with Natalia Streiner [ sic ], that by the way walked looking for work in Colombia and was called to work in Miami.</P><P>Jorge Enrique is very contented but he does not let feel nostalgia by his country, by RCN in where they offered several projects to him that still were if materializing, but that finally he would be in them. And thinking it several times, she decided to send itself to the adventure to work outside Colombia.</P><P>Jorge, we know that it is not easy to change of residence, a day [ for ] another one and to live like the gypsys, but already was time which you left to the world and being prophet in other earth. You do not create? </P><P></P><P>"Sí, clear. I believe mainly that to take the determination he is a little difficult, by my family, because being single, one goes where it wants, but to transfer the family is a very radical change and is necessary to think it more of once. Nevertheless, one evaluates the things as long as the project is worth the trouble and everything is for professional and personal growth, is worth any effort. I am very I content with my decision, although I comment you that he was a little uncertain because esteem much to the RCN executives and they already had offered me several things and to even carry out one more a soap opera ahead, but the priorities and the opportunities are unique and in that sense the heart is below the reason, so you reflect and you must go towards delante".</P><P>It is the first time that you work abroad. Why you had not done it before? </P><P></P><P>"Mira, luckyly, always I have had work in my country and that gave certain tranquillity me, so to speak, did not have necessity to go me to another side, mainly because master to live in Bogota '; but I had approaches with Television, in Mexico and in Venevisión, in Caracas, but I did not reach economic agreements and because I preferred to hope by other projects, in addition what is for one, nobody the acquittal and I feel that those projects were for mí".</P><P></P><P>That way they say that what happens is that you quote very high and who your requests are many. What has of that? </P><P>"Ja, ja, ja... I simply request what I know that they can pay, I have never taken off myself of the floor, not even with Betty the ugly one, créemelo. And sight that I say the things to you with cause knowledge; I have many friends and companions who yes request per them of the virgin and that in spite of everything, occurs them, but I simply request what I consider just. Now, that of which my requests are many, gives laughter me, because I request the conditions that any other requests, more than I get to request is that they give a house me with patio because I travel of course with my family and with my mascots, that are my three dogs. They are adorable and very inoffensive, they are very very small, but already they comprise of our lives. In addition I am defending of the animals and an injustice is made me take them of ours vidas". </P><P></P><P></P><P>Besides to defend to the animalitos, also forms part of UNICEF? </P><P>"Sí, that one is an activity that fills to me completely like being human. It is a gift of God to be able to share with these children, I am given in body and soul to this subject and the truth that me makes happy very. In fact shortly they will name Ambassador me of UNICEF in Colombia, a distinction that I am thankful enormously and that I will take advantage of to offer all the aid that is possible to me. My human work in the life is exactly this one and not the change by anything of the world. Hopefully many actors had desire to collaborate in institutions like this one, because desvalidos."would be very positive to take advantage of the public image for the pluses</P><P></P><P></P><P>Good and familiarly, cómo.estás? </P><P>"Sinceramente, it could not be better. Master to Marcela, my wife and I am every day more enamored with my Candlemas daughter. Hardly it is going to turn three years and he is tremendísima. Weeks ago one graduated as the school, he was very comedian to see it and it surprised the form to me in which it is developed. I know that for her it will be a change difficult to live in Miami, because already there were customary to his school, his companions, but the life is thus and if God wants, we are returning in less of a year, so that it returns to her school and the activities to which she is customary. In addition to which momentarily it will change of activities, imagínate that to her enchant the swimming pools and the sea to him, so it will walk like fish in the water. My wife will take advantage of east time to study in the University of Miami, so of that side we are in favor very contentments. The change without a doubt will benefit us to all, but we know clearly that what we wished is to return to Colombia".</P><P></P><P>You consider that this project is the best one at this moment to return to the international screens, mainly by the concept in which they have of super gallant of Betty the Ugly one to you? </P><P></P><P>"Uno never knows how it is going to him to go to a project. Working in something new is albur. Sometimes one him bet to something and turns out much not to be as much successful and others to the project that less him DAS, that one turns out to be hit, but that is known in the end. The public is very hard, but he is the one that decides. The ugly one does not martyr to me to surpass my work in Betty, it worries to me to be every better day and to put the soul and the heart to him to which I do. It is very difficult to surpass the success of Betty, fortunately was called on to me to live it, but that already is part of my past. I cannot live thinking about El Doctor Armando all the life. I always take it in the heart, but my race continues and never I will live on the memories, by very good that these sean". </P>
